## How to detect that a cell has scrolled off screen?


``` objc

//Determine whether the cell view is on screen. If not, stop playback
- (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)scrollView{
    if (_currentPlayIndexPath) {
        CGRect cellR = [self.tableViewrectForRowAtIndexPath:_currentPlayIndexPath];
        if(scrollView.contentOffset.y > cellR.origin.y + cellR.size.height || scrollView.contentOffset.y < cellR.origin.y - scrollView.frame.size.height){
            _currentPlayIndexPath = nil;
            //Do something when the cell scrolls off screen
        }
        NSLog(@"-------:%@",NSStringFromCGPoint(scrollView.contentOffset));
    }
}

```
