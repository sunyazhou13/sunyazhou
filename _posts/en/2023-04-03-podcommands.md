## Adding a Private Specs Repository

``` sh
pod repo add sunyazhou-specs https://www.sunyazhou.com/xxproject/Specs.git --verbose
```

## Updating the Index of a Specific Pod Spec Repository

``` sh 
pod repo update sunyazhou-specs --verbose
```

## Pushing a Local Repo's Podspec to a Remote Private Specs Repository


``` sh
pod repo push sunyazhou-specs xxxxlib.podspec --allow-warnings --use-libraries --verbose --skip-import-validation
```


The push operation here automatically triggers a git push, pushing the podspec to the remote index repository. The bunch of parameters added afterward is to suppress warnings and make compilation pass more easily.

If you do it manually, you need to create the **Library Name**/**Version Number**/**xxxlib.spec** file in the specs repository.
