## 1. What is local free translation

A large language model (LLM) does more than chat and code — translation is one of its strongest skills. But most people's first thought is ChatGPT or a translation API: online, account-gated, paid, and your content leaves the country.

Your own Mac can run an open-source model and translate Chinese Markdown into English **fully offline — free, no upload, works without internet**. This post walks you through the complete setup from zero.

The three pieces:

- **Ollama**: a local model runtime (runs the model; think Docker for containers)
- **Qwen2.5**: Alibaba's open-source model, strong in both Chinese and English; 7B runs smoothly on a Mac
- **Your browser**: calls the local model through a tool page; no command line needed for daily use

## 2. Prerequisites (read before installing)

### Hardware requirements

| Item | Minimum | Recommended | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mac chip | Apple Silicon (M1+) | Any M1/M2/M3/M4 | Intel works but is slow; Apple Silicon has MLX acceleration |
| RAM | 8 GB | **16 GB** | 8 GB can only run 3B; 16 GB handles 7B easily; 32 GB for 14B |
| Free disk space | 15 GB | 20 GB+ | Model weights ~5–10 GB, Jekyll + Ollama ~2 GB |
| macOS version | macOS 12 (Monterey) | macOS 13 / 14 / 15 | Ollama requires macOS 12+ |

> **How to check your RAM?** Apple menu → About This Mac → the "Memory" row. Same place for chip type.

### What you need to know beforehand

- Comfortable with the **Terminal** app (all commands are copy-paste, no compilation)
- Know the difference between "paste into terminal" and "press Enter"
- No English requirement — every command is copy-paste

---

## 3. Install from scratch (0 to 1)

> **One-shot script**: don't want to type step by step? The script at `tools/setup-local-llm-translator.sh` does all of this in one go. Run it:
>
> ```bash
> bash ~/Documents/sunyazhou/tools/setup-local-llm-translator.sh
> ```
>
> It **only runs on macOS** (checks OS up front and exits on anything else). It skips any step that's already done (Homebrew, Ollama, models). Check section "4. Verify your setup" after running to confirm readiness.

### Step 1: Install Homebrew (skip if already installed)

Homebrew is macOS's package manager — think App Store for the command line. Used to install Ollama and for future upgrades.

**Check if already installed**:

```bash
brew --version
```

If you see `Homebrew 4.x.x` you're done — skip to Step 2.

**Install if not**:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

It will ask for your Mac login password twice (normal, no echo) and once for Enter to confirm the install path.

> **Apple Silicon (M1 and later) only**: after installing, Homebrew will prompt you to add its path to your shell config. Copy and run those two lines, otherwise `brew` won't be found:
>
> ```bash
> (echo; echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"') >> ~/.zprofile
> eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
> ```
>
> **Intel Mac**: path is `/usr/local/bin/brew`; this step is not needed.

### Step 2: Install Ollama

Ollama is the "model runner". It is analogous to Docker — you install the runtime, but no images/models come with it.

```bash
brew install ollama
```

**Expected output** (excerpt, last few lines):

```
🍺  Congratulations! Ollama is installed.
   Run `ollama serve` to start the server.
```

> On macOS, Ollama **usually auto-starts the service** after installation, but not always. You can skip the "manually start serve" step and run `ollama list` first — if the service isn't up yet, come back and start it manually.

**Verify Ollama is installed**:

```bash
ollama --version
```

Output like `ollama version 0.x.x` is good.

### Step 3: Start the Ollama service

Translation tools and the CLI both connect to `localhost:11434`, so Ollama must keep running in the background.

**Option A: Foreground (debugging, see logs)**

```bash
ollama serve
```

The terminal will show `Ollama is running` and hang — **don't close this window**, it's the service process.

**Option B: Background (recommended; run once after install)**

```bash
nohup ollama serve > /tmp/ollama-serve.log 2>&1 &
echo "Ollama started in background, PID: $!"
```

Returns immediately to the prompt; closing the Terminal doesn't stop the service. Logs are at `/tmp/ollama-serve.log` — check with `cat /tmp/ollama-serve.log`.

**Option C: macOS LaunchAgent (auto-start on boot, recommended for daily use)**

Make Ollama start automatically every time you log in — never worry about `ollama serve` again:

```bash
# Create the plist file (run this once)
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cat > ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.ollama.plist << 'EOF'
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key><string>com.ollama.ollama</string>
    <key>ProgramArguments</key><array>
        <string>/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama</string><string>serve</string>
    </array>
    <key>RunAtLoad</key><true/>
    <key>KeepAlive</key><true/>
</dict>
</plist>
EOF

# Load and start
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.ollama.plist
echo "Set to auto-start. Verify with: launchctl list | grep ollama"
```

> **Intel Mac**: replace `/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama` with `/usr/local/bin/ollama`.

**Verify the service is up**:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```

Returns `{"models":[]}` or similar JSON — service is live. If you get `Connection refused`, go back to Option A/B/C to start it.

### Step 4: Pull the model to your machine

Ollama is installed, but **the model itself must be downloaded separately**. `ollama pull` is like `brew install` for model weight files, stored in `~/.ollama/models/`.

| Model | Size | Best for | RAM needed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `qwen2.5:3b` | ~2 GB | Fast first drafts, long posts, low-end machines | 8 GB+ |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | ~4.7 GB | **Default**: best quality/speed balance | 16 GB+ |
| `qwen2.5:14b` | ~9 GB | Highest quality, exact terminology required | 32 GB+ |

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b   # recommended: best quality
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b   # lightweight: faster, good for rough drafts
```

**Expected output** (first-time pull, shows progress):

```
pulling manifest
pulling 8ec2f7aad86b... 100%  ████████████████████  4.7 GB
pulling 4c9d85b5d93f... 100%  ████████████████████    137 B
verifying sha256 digest
writing manifest
success
```

Expect 4–15 minutes depending on network speed. **Works offline once downloaded** — weights live in `~/.ollama/models/`.

> If the pull fails mid-way (network issue), just re-run `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`. Ollama supports resume — it continues from where it left off, not from scratch.

**Verify model is installed**:

```bash
ollama list
```

Expected output:

```
NAME                 SIZE      MODIFIED
qwen2.5:7b           4.7 GB    2 minutes ago
qwen2.5:3b           1.9 GB    5 minutes ago
```

## 4. Verify your setup is ready

Run these two commands to confirm everything is green:

```bash
# Check 1: Ollama service online
curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/tags >/dev/null && echo "✓ Service is up" || echo "✗ Service not running — run ollama serve"

# Check 2: model installed
ollama list | grep -q "qwen2.5" && echo "✓ Models ready" || echo "✗ No model found — run ollama pull qwen2.5:7b"
```

Both `✓` — you're done with setup. Time to translate.

---

## 5. How to use it

### Option A: Command line (30-second check)

Translate text without opening a browser:

```bash
echo "Translate this to natural English: Using Codable to parse JSON is very convenient" | ollama run qwen2.5:7b
```

**Expected output** (a few seconds):

```
Using default招待模式。Switch modes within a session using /set mixture.
Parsing JSON with Codable is very convenient.
```

> If you end up in interactive mode (`>>>` prompt), press `Ctrl+D` (or type `/bye`) to exit.

### Option B: Blog visual tool page (recommended for writing posts)

Translating a whole Markdown post involves front matter, code blocks, and URLs — doing it all in the CLI is tedious. The tool page at `/tools/md-translator/` automates this: paste Chinese Markdown, click once, code and links stay intact.

**Step by step**:

**Step 1: Start the blog locally** (required so the browser can reach your local Ollama)

```bash
cd ~/Documents/sunyazhou   # your blog directory
bundle install             # first time only; skip on subsequent runs
bundle exec jekyll s -l -o
```

> If you see `Could not find gem 'jekyll-polyglot'`, run `gem install jekyll-polyglot` or `bundle install`.
> If it hangs at `Bundle complete!`, open a new terminal tab and run `bundle exec jekyll s` there.

**Step 2: Open the tool page**

In your browser, navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/tools/md-translator/`

> ⚠️ **Must use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost`**. Do not open with `file://`. Avoid `0.0.0.0` — some machines route `0.0.0.0` traffic differently, and the browser won't reach `localhost:11434`.

**Step 3: Translate**

| Button | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Translate | Translates the input area with the selected model |
| Load Sample | Fills in sample Chinese Markdown — click Translate to see the effect |
| Save Locally | Chrome / Edge: native macOS save dialog (recommended); Safari / Firefox: downloads to default folder |
| Copy | Copies output to clipboard |
| Clear | Clears both input and output |

**Step 4: Save to your blog**

After translation:

1. Click "Save Locally" → Chrome shows the macOS native save dialog
2. Navigate to your blog's `_posts/en/` folder
3. Confirm the filename (the tool auto-names it using the front matter date + English slug)
4. Click "Save"

> Example filename: `2026-08-27-local-llm-markdown-translator.md`

**The tool's protection mechanisms** (why feeding a raw file to the model would mangle code and URLs):

- **Front matter**: only `title` / `description` are translated; `date`, `tags`, `categories` etc. are kept verbatim
- **Fenced code blocks** ` ```swift `: locked with a placeholder, restored after — the model never touches code
- **Inline code** `` `Codable` ``: same protection
- **Links / image URLs**: only the visible text is translated; the address itself is untouched (even `title` attributes are preserved)
- **Glossary**: terms entered in "Locked glossary" (comma-separated, e.g. `KVO, KVC, Codable`) are locked and never translated — keeps terms consistent across the whole file
- **Chunked by blank lines**: long posts are split and translated concurrently; chunks with no Chinese are skipped; everything is losslessly stitched back together

**Minimal example** (verifying protection works):

Input (Chinese):

~~~markdown
# 用 Codable 解析 JSON

Swift 里 `Codable` 很好用，参考 [文档](https://developer.apple.com/codable)。

```swift
struct User: Codable { let name: String }
```
~~~

Output (English, code and URL intact):

~~~markdown
# Parse JSON with Codable

`Codable` is very useful in Swift. Check the [docs](https://developer.apple.com/codable).

```swift
struct User: Codable { let name: String }
```
~~~

> This tool is **for your own writing** — not for site visitors. The live blog is pure static Jekyll with no backend; a visitor's browser `localhost:11434` points at *their* computer, not yours. Only you can use it while running `jekyll serve` locally.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Connection issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Translation says "can't reach Ollama" | `ollama serve` not running | Re-run: `ollama serve` (new terminal tab; don't close it) |
| `curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost:11434` | Port not open / service down | `lsof -i :11434` to check; `ollama serve` to start |
| Can't connect after sleep / reboot | Service was killed | Re-run `ollama serve` (models stay, no re-pull needed) |
| Tool page blank | Not opened via jekyll local address | Use `http://127.0.0.1:4000/tools/md-translator/`, not `file://` |
| Browser shows `0.0.0.0:4000` | Jekyll bound to all interfaces | Kill Jekyll and re-run `bundle exec jekyll s -H 127.0.0.1 -l -o` |

### Model issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Model not found" error | Model not installed | `ollama list` to check; `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` |
| `ollama pull` stuck at 0% | Network cannot reach ollama.com | Switch to a better network / wait; supports resume — re-run to continue |
| Pull failed mid-way | Network glitch | Re-run `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`; it resumes from where it left off |
| Pull too slow | Slow network | Try late night or a better network; qwen2.5:3b is only 2 GB and much faster |

### Memory issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mac gets hot / fans loud during translation | Normal (model inference is CPU/GPU intensive) | Expected; Mac thermal design handles this fine |
| Translation hangs then times out | Not enough RAM for 7B | Switch to 3B: `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b`; change model box to `qwen2.5:3b` |
| `Killed: 9` or "Out of memory" | 8 GB Mac trying to run 14B | Downgrade to 3B or 7B |

### Quality issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Translation modified code block content | Placeholder protection bug | Report it; use "Load Sample" first to confirm code blocks stay intact |
| Translation changed a URL | Chinese params in URL got translated | Tool should handle this; report if you see it |
| Terminology inconsistent across file | Model didn't recognize a term | Add it to the "Locked glossary" field (comma-separated) and re-translate |
| Output is garbled | Model inference error | Switch to 3B or re-pull: `ollama rm qwen2.5:7b && ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` |

### Other

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ollama: command not found` | Homebrew PATH not configured | Add to `~/.zshrc`: `eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"` then run it |
| `ollama serve` says port in use | Another process on port 11434 | `lsof -i :11434` to find PID; `kill -9 <PID>` to stop it |
| Jekyll says `Could not find gem` | Missing Ruby gem | `bundle install` |
| `bundle install` permission error | Blog directory ownership issue | `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/Documents/sunyazhou` |

---

## 7. Swap models

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:14b   # highest quality, but 16 GB RAM gets tight; 32 GB recommended
```

Change the model name in the tool page's "Model" input box to `qwen2.5:14b` (or any pulled model name) — **no restart of Ollama or Jekyll needed**, just refresh and try.

---

## 8. Long-term maintenance

### Update Ollama

```bash
brew upgrade ollama
```

### Update a model (re-pull latest version)

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b   # downloads and replaces with the newest version
```

### List installed models

```bash
ollama list
```

### Remove an unused model

```bash
ollama rm qwen2.5:3b   # frees ~2 GB
```

### Full uninstall (clean slate)

```bash
# Stop LaunchAgent (if configured)
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.ollama.plist
rm ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ollama.ollama.plist

# Uninstall Ollama
brew uninstall ollama

# Delete all model weights (~10 GB; asks for confirmation)
rm -rf ~/.ollama

# Remove Homebrew (optional)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/uninstall.sh)"
```

---

## 9. Command reference

| Scenario | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Install Homebrew | `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"` |
| Install Ollama | `brew install ollama` |
| Start service (foreground) | `ollama serve` |
| Start service (background) | `nohup ollama serve > /tmp/ollama-serve.log 2>&1 &` |
| Check service is up | `curl -s http://localhost:11434/api/tags` |
| Pull 7B model | `ollama pull qwen2.5:7b` |
| Pull 3B model | `ollama pull qwen2.5:3b` |
| List installed models | `ollama list` |
| Delete a model | `ollama rm qwen2.5:7b` |
| Translate one line via CLI | `echo "sentence to translate" \| ollama run qwen2.5:7b` |
| Start blog | `cd ~/Documents/sunyazhou && bundle exec jekyll s -l -o` |
| Open tool page | `http://127.0.0.1:4000/tools/md-translator/` |
| Update Ollama | `brew upgrade ollama` |

---

## 10. Tips and wrap-up

- **Default to 7B**: best balance of quality and speed; 16 GB Mac handles it without breaking a sweat.
- **Keep a glossary**: put project-specific terms in the glossary field for consistent translation throughout the file.
- **Privacy first**: fully local — safe to paste unpublished content.
- **Free & offline forever**: install once, zero ongoing cost.
- **LaunchAgent saves the day**: configure it once and Ollama starts automatically on every login — never hunt for `ollama serve` again.

From installing Homebrew and Ollama, pulling Qwen2.5, to translating a full blog post via the tool page — not a cent spent, nothing leaving your machine. That's the 0 to 1 of local free translation.
