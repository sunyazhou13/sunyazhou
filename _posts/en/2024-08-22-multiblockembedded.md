## A Problem Encountered in Development

How to correctly use a block's weakSelf and strongSelf in Objective-C across multiple nested blocks

In Objective-C, `weak self` and `strong self` are used to solve the problem of retain cycles. When you use `self` as a parameter of a block, you need to use `__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;` to create a weak reference in order to avoid a retain cycle. Then, inside the block, you can use `strongSelf` to obtain a strong reference.

The following is an example showing how to use `weak self` and `strong self` in a three-layer nested method:

``` objc
- (void)outerMethod {
    __weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
    [self innerMethod1:^{
        __weak typeof(weakSelf) weakSelf2 = weakSelf;
        [weakSelf2 innerMethod2:^{
            __weak typeof(weakSelf2) weakSelf3 = weakSelf2;
            [weakSelf3 innerMethod3:^{
                __strong typeof(weakSelf3) strongSelf = weakSelf3;
                // 在这里使用strongSelf进行操作
            }];
        }];
    }];
}

- (void)innerMethod1:(void (^)(void))completion {
    // ...
    if (completion) {
        completion();
    }
}

- (void)innerMethod2:(void (^)(void))completion {
    // ...
    if (completion) {
        completion();
    }
}

- (void)innerMethod3:(void (^)(void))completion {
    // ...
    if (completion) {
        completion();
    }
}
```

In this example, we use `__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;` to create a weak reference in each layer's method, and in the next layer we use `__weak typeof(weakSelf) weakSelf2 = weakSelf;`. Finally, in the innermost method, we use `__strong typeof(weakSelf3) strongSelf = weakSelf3;` to obtain a strong reference for use within that layer's method.
