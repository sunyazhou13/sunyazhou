# Preface

In iOS development, we often locate bugs through crash stacks. At that point we need a symbol table to restore the code-call information corresponding to memory addresses. To lift the veil on this question that everyone has heard of but people always ask about, I collected and organized relevant knowledge from the bugle platform and various articles for easy reference later.

## This Week's Main Content

* What is a symbol table?
* Why configure a symbol table?
* What is a dSYM file?

### What Is a Symbol Table?

A symbol table is a mapping table between memory addresses and function names, file names, and line numbers. The elements of a symbol table are shown below:

`<start address>` `<end address>` `<function>` [`<file name>`:`<line number>`]  

### Why Configure a Symbol Table?

To quickly and accurately locate the code `position` where a user's app `Crashes`, we can use a symbol table to `parse` and `restore` the program's `stack` at the point where the app `Crash` occurred.

Here's an example:

![stack Symbol](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/stackSymbol.avif)

The image above shows the crash stack calls we resolved using the symbol table.

### What Is a dSYM File?

On the iOS platform, a `dSYM` file is a target file containing debug information, and the file name is usually `com.companyname.dSYM`. As shown below:

![testd SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/testdSYM.avif)

Generally it has the same name as the target of the Xcode project.

> To make it easier to find the dSYM file corresponding to a Crash and restore the stack, it's recommended to back up the dSYM file every time you build or release an app version.

#### How to Locate the dSYM File?

In general, after the project is compiled, the `dSYM` file is in the same directory as the `app` file. Below I'll explain in detail how to locate the `dSYM` file using `XCode` as the IDE.

![d SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/dSYM1.avif)

![d SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/dSYM2.avif)

> The test here was done in Release mode.

We can see the `.dSYM` with the same name as the project `target`.

#### No dSYM File Generated After Compiling in Xcode?

By default, Xcode generates a `dSYM` file in the `Release` build configuration, but not in the `Debug` build configuration.

If you want it in `Debug`, configure Xcode like this:

`XCode -> Build Settings -> Code Generation -> Generate Debug Symbols -> Yes`  
`XCode -> Build Settings -> Build Option -> Debug Information Format -> DWARF with dSYM File`

![d SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/dSYM3.avif)

#### What to Watch Out For After Enabling Bitcode?

* When uploading to the `App Store` server via `Upload to App Store`, you need to declare the generation of the symbol file (`dSYM` file):

![d SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/dSYM5.avif)

* Before configuring the symbol table file, you need to download the dSYM file for that version from the App Store to your local machine, and then use a symbol table tool to generate and upload the symbol table file.

There are two ways to retrieve the dSYM file for an `ipa` version:

1. Retrieve the dSYM through Xcode's archived files. Open `Xcode` top menu bar -> `Window` -> `Organizer`, as shown below:
	![Bitcoded SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/BitcodedSYM2.avif)  
	Open the `Xcode` top menu bar and select the `Archive` tab:   
	![Bitcoded SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/BitcodedSYM3.avif)  
	Find the released archive, right-click it and choose `Show in Finder`:  
	![Bitcoded SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/BitcodedSYM4.avif)
	Right-click the located archive file and choose to show package contents:  
	![Bitcoded SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/BitcodedSYM5.avif)  
	Select the `dSYMs` directory; the directory contains the downloaded `dSYM` files:  
	![Bitcoded SYM](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/BitcodedSYM6.avif)
	
2. Retrieve it through [iTunes Connect](https://itunesconnect.apple.com/)
	
	![itunes Connect](/assets/images/20180308WhatIsThedSYM/itunesConnect.avif)
	
	In "All Builds", select a version and click "Download dSYM" to download the dSYM file.
	
	

> Note: _an `Archiver` corresponds one-to-one with the `dSYM` file. If you mix them up, it's easy to fail to resolve the source code calls._

## Symbol Resolution Command (Updated April 3, 2024)

``` sh
atos -o KWPlayer.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/KWPlayer -arch arm64 -l 0x102100000 0x10720df70 0x10720a5ac 0x10720e13c 0x107211aa0 0x107215574 0x107211aa0 0x10720770c 0x10720772c 0x10720f6ec 0x10720f9e8 0x107208df0 0x1072039b8
```
Here's the output:

``` objc
-[LOTLayerContainer display] (in KWPlayer) (LOTLayerContainer.m:385)
-[LOTCompositionContainer displayWithFloatFrame:forceUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTCompositionContainer.m:107)
-[LOTLayerContainer displayWithFloatFrame:forceUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTLayerContainer.m:411)
-[LOTRenderGroup updateWithFrame:withModifierBlock:forceLocalUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTRenderGroup.m:142)
-[LOTTrimPathNode updateWithFrame:withModifierBlock:forceLocalUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTTrimPathNode.m:62)
-[LOTRenderGroup updateWithFrame:withModifierBlock:forceLocalUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTRenderGroup.m:142)
-[LOTAnimatorNode updateWithFrame:withModifierBlock:forceLocalUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTAnimatorNode.m:51)
-[LOTAnimatorNode updateWithFrame:withModifierBlock:forceLocalUpdate:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTAnimatorNode.m:54)
-[LOTPathAnimator performLocalUpdate] (in KWPlayer) (LOTPathAnimator.m:36)
-[LOTPathInterpolator pathForFrame:cacheLengths:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTPathInterpolator.m:0)
-[LOTBezierPath LOT_addCurveToPoint:controlPoint1:controlPoint2:] (in KWPlayer) (LOTBezierPath.m:167)
LOT_PointInCubicCurve (in KWPlayer) (CGGeometry+LOTAdditions.m:366)
```

After the `-l` command you can pass multiple addresses, separated by `,` commas or spaces.

Here's the raw file:

``` sh
