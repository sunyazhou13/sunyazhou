# Code Snippet

``` objc
/// Keep the aspect ratio unchanged while ensuring width and height do not exceed the maximum limit of 2048
/// - Parameter imageSize: original size
- (CGSize)keepScaleSize:(CGSize)imageSize
{
    if (kw_is_float_zero(imageSize.width) || kw_is_float_zero(imageSize.height)) { return imageSize; }
    //check whether it exceeds the maximum limit
    if (imageSize.width < 2048 && imageSize.height < 2048) { return imageSize; }
    //exceeds the maximum limit
    CGSize resize = CGSizeZero;
    if (imageSize.width > imageSize.height) {
        //the longest side is the width
        CGFloat ratio = imageSize.height / imageSize.width;
        CGFloat disWidth = 2048;
        CGFloat disHeight = disWidth * ratio;
        resize = CGSizeMake(disWidth, disHeight);
    } else {
        //the longest side is the height
        CGFloat ratio = imageSize.width / imageSize.height;
        CGFloat disHeight = 2048;
        CGFloat disWidth = disHeight * ratio;
        resize = CGSizeMake(disWidth, disHeight);
    }
    return resize;
}
```

# Summary

During development there are some calculation methods that are easy to work out but easy to forget, and hard to find again when you need them — so here's a code snippet recorded for reference.
