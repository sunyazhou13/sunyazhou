In one of my previous articles, I shared a simple way to create particle effects in SwiftUI — using a `ViewModifier`, which is very neat. But I don't recommend it for production, because every particle is a separate view, and the performance overhead becomes significant once the particle count grows.

This article presents a **better alternative**: using the `Canvas` view to render particles. Let's go 💪

---

## Basic Architecture

Let's start with the following view skeleton:

```swift
struct ParticleCanvasView: View {
    
    var body: some View {
        TimelineView(.animation) { context in
            Canvas { context, size in
                let particleSymbol = context.resolveSymbol(id: 0)!
                let position = CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: size.height/2)
                context.draw(particleSymbol, at: position, anchor: .center)
            } symbols: {
                SingleParticleView()
                    .tag(0)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

There's an outer `TimelineView` that's responsible for periodically triggering redraws of the inner view. The main content is the `Canvas` view.

For those with a UIKit background, the concept of a drawing context should be familiar: we get a canvas area with size information, then draw various elements on it — shapes, images, and so on.

In our example, the particle to be drawn is represented by `SingleParticleView`. Note that it's placed in the `symbols` parameter — this means SwiftUI will **pre-render** it, making each subsequent draw call extremely efficient, which is great for large numbers of particles ;)

Let's first define `SingleParticleView` as a small orange dot:

```swift
struct SingleParticleView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle().fill(Color.orange)
            .frame(width: 35, height: 35)
    }
}
```

## Making It Move

Now let's make the particle move.

I want to achieve an effect similar to fire — multiple particles floating upward. Let's start with the simplest thing: make a single particle move up from the bottom of the canvas periodically:

```swift
struct ParticleCanvasView: View {
    let movementDuration = 2.0
    
    var body: some View {
        TimelineView(.animation) { context in
            let timeInterval = context.date.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate

            let time = timeInterval.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: movementDuration) / movementDuration
            
            Canvas { context, size in
                let particleSymbol = context.resolveSymbol(id: 0)!
                let position = CGPoint(x: size.width/2, y: (1 - time) * size.height)
                context.draw(particleSymbol, at: position, anchor: .center)
            } symbols: {
                SingleParticleView().tag(0)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The upward motion is controlled by the `time` variable. `TimelineView` provides the time property, but we need a normalized value that's convenient to bind to the particle's motion. Here I set each motion to last 2 seconds (`movementDuration`), and use a truncating remainder so that `time` always grows periodically from 0 to 1.

## Remember Trigonometry?

Next, let's upgrade the motion from a boring straight line to something more "fire-like" :)

The feel of fire is that it flickers, so let's make the particle move along a **cosine wave** path, with the amplitude gradually shrinking as the particle rises:

```swift
struct ParticleCanvasView: View {
    let movementDuration = 2.0
    
    func particlePosition(timeInterval: Double, canvasSize: CGSize) -> CGPoint {
        let time = timeInterval.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: movementDuration) / movementDuration
        let rotations: CGFloat = 3
        let amplitude: CGFloat = 0.1 + 0.8 * (1 - time)
        let x = canvasSize.width/2 + cos(rotations * time * CGFloat.pi * 2) * canvasSize.width/2 * amplitude
        return CGPoint(x: x, y: (1 - time) * canvasSize.height)
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        TimelineView(.animation) { context in
            let timeInterval = context.date.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate
            Canvas { context, size in
                let particleSymbol = context.resolveSymbol(id: 0)!
                let position = particlePosition(timeInterval: timeInterval, canvasSize: size)
                context.draw(particleSymbol, at: position, anchor: .center)
            } symbols: {
                SingleParticleView().tag(0)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The position calculation is extracted into a separate function to keep the Canvas closure clean.

## Generating Lots of Particles

The motion effect is satisfying. Now let's wrap the drawing in a for loop to draw more particles at once:

```swift
let particleCount = 100
// …
for i in 0..<particleCount {
    let position = particlePosition(
        timeInterval: timeInterval + (Double(i) / Double(particleCount)),
        canvasSize: size
    )
    context.draw(particleSymbol, at: position, anchor: .center)
}
```

## Randomization

Now there are more particles, but they all follow the same path, which looks too uniform. Use random **initial rotation angles** and **time offsets** to let each particle go its own way:

```swift
struct ParticleCanvasView: View {
    let movementDuration: Double
    let particleCount: Int
    let startingParticleOffsets: [CGFloat]
    let startingParticleAlphas: [CGFloat]
    
    init(particleCount: Int = 200, movementDuration: Double = 3.0) {
        self.particleCount = particleCount
        self.movementDuration = movementDuration
        self.startingParticleOffsets = (0..<particleCount).map { _ in CGFloat.random(in: 0...1) }
        self.startingParticleAlphas  = (0..<particleCount).map { _ in CGFloat.random(in: 0...CGFloat.pi*2) }
    }
    
    func particlePosition(index: Int, timeInterval: Double, canvasSize: CGSize) -> CGPoint {
        let startingRotation  = startingParticleAlphas[index]
        let startingTimeOffset = startingParticleOffsets[index] * movementDuration
        
        let time = (timeInterval + startingTimeOffset)
            .truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: movementDuration) / movementDuration
        let rotations: CGFloat = 3
        let amplitude: CGFloat = 0.1 + 0.8 * (1 - time)
        
        let x = canvasSize.width/2 + cos(rotations * time * CGFloat.pi * 2 + startingRotation)
                 * canvasSize.width/2 * amplitude
        return CGPoint(x: x, y: (1 - time) * canvasSize.height)
    }
    // … body stays the same
}
```

## Polishing the Visuals

The motion logic is done; now we need to polish the look to make the effect juicier.

**Step 1:** Change the particle opacity during motion — modify the context's opacity before the draw call:

```swift
context.opacity = positionAndAlpha.1
```

**Step 2:** Redesign the particle's appearance using a blend mode:

```swift
struct SingleParticleView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle().fill(Color.orange.opacity(0.4))
            .frame(width: 35, height: 35)
            .blendMode(.plusLighter)
            .blur(radius: 10)
    }
}
```

The particles are made into large blurred dots; when they overlap, the `.plusLighter` blend brightens the overlapping regions, creating a volumetric fire effect.

There's another issue that bothered me: particles are denser at the top, and I wanted the opposite. Adjust the y-coordinate formula to fix it:

```swift
let y = (1 - time * time) * canvasSize.height
```

    let startingParticleOffsets: [CGFloat]
    let startingParticleAlphas: [CGFloat]

        self.startingParticleAlphas  = (0..<particleCount).map { _ in CGFloat.random(in: 0...CGFloat.pi*2) }
    }

        let startingTimeOffset = startingParticleOffsets[index] * movementDuration
        
        let time = (timeInterval + startingTimeOffset)
            .truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: movementDuration) / movementDuration
        let rotations: CGFloat = 1.5
        let amplitude: CGFloat = 0.1 + 0.8 * (1 - time)
        
        let x = canvasSize.width/2 + cos(rotations * time * CGFloat.pi * 2 + startingRotation)
                 * canvasSize.width/2 * amplitude * 0.8
        let y = (1 - time * time) * canvasSize.height
        
        return (CGPoint(x: x, y: y), 1 - time)
    }
    
    var body: some View {
        TimelineView(.animation) { context in
            let timeInterval = context.date.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate
            Canvas { context, size in
                let particleSymbol = context.resolveSymbol(id: 0)!
                for i in 0..<particleCount {
                    let positionAndAlpha = particlePositionAndAlpha(
                        index: i, timeInterval: timeInterval, canvasSize: size
                    )
                    context.opacity = positionAndAlpha.1
                    context.draw(particleSymbol, at: positionAndAlpha.0, anchor: .center)
                }
            } symbols: {
                SingleParticleView().tag(0)
            }
        }
    }
}
```
