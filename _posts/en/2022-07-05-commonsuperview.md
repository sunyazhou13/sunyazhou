# Implementation Code


``` objc

// Usage
- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    Class commonClass1 = [self commonClass:[ViewA class] andClass:[ViewC class]];
    NSLog(@"%@",commonClass1);
    // 输出：2022-07-03 17:36:01.868966+0800 两个UIView的最近公共父类[84288:2458900] ViewD
}

// Get all superclasses
- (NSArray *)superClasses:(Class)class {
    if (class == nil) {
        return @[];
    }
    NSMutableArray *result = [NSMutableArray array];
    while (class != nil) {
        [result addObject:class];
        class = [class superclass];
    }
    return [result copy];
}
// We first put every node along one path into an NSSet. Since NSSet is backed by a hash table internally, element lookup becomes O(1). With N nodes in total, the overall time complexity is optimized to O(N).
- (Class)commonClass:(Class)classA andClass:(Class)classB{
    NSArray *arr1 = [self superClasses:classA];
    NSArray *arr2 = [self superClasses:classB];
    NSSet *set = [NSSet setWithArray:arr2];
    for (NSUInteger i =0; i<arr1.count; ++i) {
        Class targetClass = arr1[i];
        if ([set containsObject:targetClass]) {
            return targetClass;
        }
    }
    return nil;
}
```


# Summary

This problem is similar to finding the nearest common ancestor in a binary tree. For reference, see Masonry's implementation:
