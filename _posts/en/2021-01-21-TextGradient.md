I recently saw an article published by Sohu, which included a section on how to add gradient colors to text using a `non-mask` approach. Because the mask approach is very performance-intensive, as mask triggers off-screen rendering. In today's demo, I used my previous demo as an example.


## Implementing Gradient Colors in Scrolling Subtitles

The core implementation is simple. The article [A Complete Guide to iOS Video Danmaku System](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/4pWrwmZBEbrca2uxIt3o6w) didn't provide the relevant demo. It only roughly described the implementation approach for the danmaku. So as an iOS developer, you should be proactive in writing code to implement and verify the approach. Honestly, I really dislike this kind of Sohu article that has a beginning but no end — it just talks about the concept without providing any code demo. That's obviously not being straightforward.

Our implementation here is quite simple. Just calculate the size of the text, then use CoreGraphicContext to draw an image.

The core code is as follows:

``` objc
+ (UIImage *)gradientFromColor:(UIColor *)fromeColor toColor:(UIColor *)toColor andSize:(CGSize)imageSize {
    if (fromeColor == nil) { fromeColor = [UIColor clearColor]; }
    if (toColor == nil) { toColor = [UIColor clearColor]; }
    NSArray* gradientColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: (id)fromeColor.CGColor, (id)toColor.CGColor, nil];
    CGFloat scale = [UIScreen mainScreen].scale;
    UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptions(imageSize, NO, scale);
    CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
    CGContextSaveGState(context);
    CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorGetColorSpace([fromeColor CGColor]);
    CGGradientRef gradient = CGGradientCreateWithColors(colorSpace, (CFArrayRef)gradientColors, NULL);
    CGPoint start = CGPointMake(0.0, 0.0);
    CGPoint end = CGPointMake(imageSize.width, 0.0);
    CGContextDrawLinearGradient(context, gradient, start, end, kCGGradientDrawsBeforeStartLocation | kCGGradientDrawsAfterEndLocation);
    UIImage *image = UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext();
    CGGradientRelease(gradient);
    CGContextRestoreGState(context);
    UIGraphicsEndImageContext();
    return image;
}
```

The key emphasis here is on two lines of code:

``` objc
// Get the color space for the gradient color
CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace = CGColorGetColorSpace([fromeColor CGColor]);
// Then create a linear gradient using the gradient array; the direction can be set at the start and end CGPoint locations in the code
NSArray* gradientColors = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: (id)fromeColor.CGColor, (id)toColor.CGColor, nil];
CGGradientRef gradient = CGGradientCreateWithColors(colorSpace, (CFArrayRef)gradientColors, NULL);

```

Below is a demonstration of my implementation logic. The demo will be provided below for you to download.

# Summary

Second article of 2021. Time is tight. When I have time, I'll study Sohu's danmaku system and write a demo.
