# The Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

A `subarray` is a contiguous part of an array.

#### Example 1

``` sh
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The contiguous subarray [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum, which is 6.
```

#### Example 2

``` sh
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

#### Example 3

``` sh
Input: nums = [5,4,-1,7,8]
Output: 23
```

## Answer

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSubArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int pre = 0, maxAns = nums[0];
        for (const auto &x: nums) {
            pre = max( pre + x, x);
            maxAns = max(maxAns,pre);
        }
        return maxAns;
    }
};
```
