# Problem

Recently I've been developing widgets on iOS 17 using the SwiftUI framework. On my first attempt at building it in a project, I ran into an API availability-checking problem.

My previous widgets were lock-screen widgets running on iOS 16. iOS 17 recently added new content, and when running, it prompts you to add

``` swift
containerBackground(.red.gradient, for: .widget)
```

such an adapted container. This means the `some View` API that worked on iOS 16 now has to use the iOS 17 API.

``` swift
ZStack(alignment: .bottomTrailing) {
        Image("widget_clock")
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
        
        VStack(spacing: 0) {
            Text("\(entry.date.hour)")
            Text("\(entry.date.min)")
        }
        .font(.system(size: 60, weight: .bold))
        .foregroundColor(.white)
    }
    . if #available(iOSApplicationExtension 17.0, *) {   //这行代码报错 告知我不能这样做 不识别if 
            $0.containerBackground(.red.gradient, for: .widget)
        } else {
            // Fallback on earlier versions
        }
```

After researching for a while, I found that I need to extend View with a function that returns itself for chained configuration.

I really couldn't figure out how to write it properly, so in the end I just wrote an extension for View.


``` swift
import Foundation
import SwiftUI

public extension View {
    func modify<Content>(@ViewBuilder _ transform: (Self) -> Content) -> Content {
        transform(self)
    }
}

```

Then when using it:

``` swift
.modify{
    if #available(iOSApplicationExtension 17.0, *) {
        $0.containerBackground(.red.gradient, for: .widget)
    } else {
        // Fallback on earlier versions
    }
}
```

Only this way can it compile successfully in SwiftUI's body.

Here's the complete test code:

``` swift
struct MomentsWidget: Widget {
    let kind: String = WidgetType.moments.kind
    
    var body: some WidgetConfiguration {
        IntentConfiguration(kind: kind, intent: ConfigurationIntent.self, provider: MomentsWidgetProvider()) { entry in
            MomentsWidgetEntryView(entry: entry)
                .modify{  // The adaptation code
                    if #available(iOSApplicationExtension 17.0, *) {
                        $0.containerBackground(.white.gradient, for: .widget)
                    } else {
                        // Fallback on earlier versions
                    }
                }
        }
        // This defines the title and subtitle shown in the widget's popup interface
        .configurationDisplayName("好友动态")
        .description("通过该组件可以创建好友动态列表")
        .supportedFamilies([.systemLarge])
    }
}
```

# Summary

1. Writing SwiftUI feels like when I first touched UIKit — hard at the beginning, because I lack understanding of it.
2. SwiftUI's framework design should have taken this kind of problem into account and provided a dedicated API, or at least Xcode's suggestions shouldn't be wrong. When even what Xcode provides is wrong, it only shows that the thing isn't mature yet.
