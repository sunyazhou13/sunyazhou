Preface
--

In `AV Foundation`, using the `AVAudioRecorder` class to add audio recording is just as simple as using `AVAudioPlayer`. Both are built on top of the `Audio Queue Server`, and both support the `macOS` and `iOS` platforms. You can record from the built-in microphone, as well as from a digital audio interface or an external USB microphone.

Main topics of this post:
--
    How to create AVAudioRecorder
        1. Audio format
        2. Sample rate
        3. Number of channels
    Create a demo
        1. Configure the audio session
        2. Implement recording
        3. Visualize the sound wave with Audio Metering

Before creating an `AVAudioRecorder`, let's first take a look at its methods and member variables.

``` objc
@property (readonly, getter=isRecording) BOOL recording;//是否正在录音
@property (readonly) NSDictionary<NSString *, id> *settings;//录音配置：采样率、音频格式、通道数...
@property (readonly) NSURL *url;//录音文件存放URL
@property (readonly) NSTimeInterval currentTime;//录音时长
@property (getter=isMeteringEnabled) BOOL meteringEnabled;//是否监控声波
```

Instance methods of `AVAudioRecorder`:

``` objc
- (BOOL)prepareToRecord;//为录音准备缓冲区
- (BOOL)record;//录音开始，暂停后调用会恢复录音
- (BOOL)recordAtTime:(NSTimeInterval)time;//在指定时间后开始录音
- (BOOL)recordForDuration:(NSTimeInterval) duration;//按指定时长录音
- (BOOL)recordAtTime:(NSTimeInterval)time 
         forDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration;//上面2个的合体
- (void)pause; //暂停录音
- (void)stop; //停止录音
- (BOOL)deleteRecording;//删除录音，必须先停止录音再删除
```

Delegate methods of `AVAudioRecorder`:

``` objc
//Called when recording finishes
- (void)audioRecorderDidFinishRecording:(AVAudioRecorder *)recorder 
                           successfully:(BOOL)flag;
//Called when a recording encoding error occurs
- (void)audioRecorderEncodeErrorDidOccur:(AVAudioRecorder *)recorder 
                                   error:(NSError *)error;
```

How to create an `AVAudioRecorder`
--

Here are the parameters required to create an `AVAudioRecorder` object:

* The path URL on the local disk where the audio stream is written during recording
* `settings` recording configuration: a dictionary of key-value parameters such as sample rate, audio format, number of channels, etc.
* An `NSError` pointer for error reporting

Like this:

``` objc
/**
 Create a recorder
 */
- (void)createRecorder {
    NSString *directory = NSTemporaryDirectory();
    NSString *filePath = [directory stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"voice1.m4a"];
    NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:filePath];
    
    NSDictionary *setting = @{AVFormatIDKey : @(kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC),
                              AVSampleRateKey: @22050.0f,
                              AVNumberOfChannelsKey: @1};
    NSError *error;
    self.recorder = [[AVAudioRecorder alloc] initWithURL:url
                                                settings:setting
                                                   error:&error];
    if (self.recorder) {
        [self.recorder prepareToRecord];
    } else {
        NSLog(@"Recorder Create Error: %@", [error localizedDescription]);
    }
}
```

Here it is recommended to call the `[self.recorder prepareToRecord]` method to pre-configure the recording instance, similar to creating an `AVAudioPlayer` in the [previous chapter](http://sunyazhou.com/2017/03/17/Learning-AV-Foundation-AVAudioPlayer/). Both are necessary steps to run the low-level `Audio Queue` initialization. This `prepareToRecord` method also creates a file at the location specified by the given URL parameter, which reduces the latency when recording starts.

Audio Format
--
The `AVFormatIDKey` key specifies the recording format. Besides `kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC`, the following formats are also available:

``` objc
CF_ENUM(AudioFormatID)
{
    kAudioFormatLinearPCM               = 'lpcm',
    kAudioFormatAC3                     = 'ac-3',
    kAudioFormat60958AC3                = 'cac3',
    kAudioFormatAppleIMA4               = 'ima4',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC                = 'aac ',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4CELP               = 'celp',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4HVXC               = 'hvxc',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4TwinVQ             = 'twvq',
    kAudioFormatMACE3                   = 'MAC3',
    kAudioFormatMACE6                   = 'MAC6',
    kAudioFormatULaw                    = 'ulaw',
    kAudioFormatALaw                    = 'alaw',
    kAudioFormatQDesign                 = 'QDMC',
    kAudioFormatQDesign2                = 'QDM2',
    kAudioFormatQUALCOMM                = 'Qclp',
    kAudioFormatMPEGLayer1              = '.mp1',
    kAudioFormatMPEGLayer2              = '.mp2',
    kAudioFormatMPEGLayer3              = '.mp3',
    kAudioFormatTimeCode                = 'time',
    kAudioFormatMIDIStream              = 'midi',
    kAudioFormatParameterValueStream    = 'apvs',
    kAudioFormatAppleLossless           = 'alac',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_HE             = 'aach',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_LD             = 'aacl',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_ELD            = 'aace',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_ELD_SBR        = 'aacf',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_ELD_V2         = 'aacg',    
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_HE_V2          = 'aacp',
    kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC_Spatial        = 'aacs',
    kAudioFormatAMR                     = 'samr',
    kAudioFormatAMR_WB                  = 'sawb',
    kAudioFormatAudible                 = 'AUDB',
    kAudioFormatiLBC                    = 'ilbc',
    kAudioFormatDVIIntelIMA             = 0x6D730011,
    kAudioFormatMicrosoftGSM            = 0x6D730031,
    kAudioFormatAES3                    = 'aes3',
    kAudioFormatEnhancedAC3             = 'ec-3'
};

```
Here `kAudioFormatLinearPCM` writes the uncompressed audio stream to the file. This is the raw data, offering the highest fidelity but also the largest file size. Choosing formats like ACC`kAudioFormatMPEG4AAC` or AppleIMA4`kAudioFormatAppleLossless` will significantly reduce the file size while still maintaining audio quality.
> *Note:*
> *The specified audio format must match the file type of the URL you write to. If you record a xxx.wav file, it must follow the Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE) requirements, i.e., little-endian LinearPCM. If the value specified for `AVFormatIDKey` is not `kAudioFormatLinearPCM`, an error will occur. NSError will return an error like the following:*
> *The operation couldn't be completed. (OSState error 1718449215.)*

Sample Rate
--

In the code above, `AVSampleRateKey` is used to define the sample rate of the recorder. **The sample rate defines the number of samples taken per second of the input analog audio signal.** Using a **low sample rate**, such as 8kHz, results in a coarse, AM radio-like recording quality, though the file size is smaller; using a **44.1kHz sample rate (CD-quality sample rate)** yields very high quality content, but the file is larger. There are no strict rules about which sample rate to use, but developers should try to stick to **standard sample rates, such as 8000Hz, 16000Hz (16kHz), 22050Hz (22.05kHz), or 44100Hz (44.1kHz), and of course 48000Hz and 96000Hz** (kHz stands for kilohertz). Sample rates above 48000 or 96000 are meaningless to the human ear. Ultimately, it's our ears that do the judging. (The [previous chapter](http://sunyazhou.com/2017/03/17/Learning-AV-Foundation-AVAudioPlayer/) mentioned that **the audible frequency range of the human ear starts from a low of 20Hz up to a high of 20kHz**, so recording is best done at 2x that frequency.)

Number of Channels
--

`AVNumberOfChannelsKey` is used to define the number of channels for the recorded audio content. **Setting the default value 1 means recording in mono**, **while setting 2 means recording in stereo**. Unless you are recording with external hardware, you should generally create mono recordings. The number of channels here refers to the number of inputs on the recording device, which can be understood as the built-in microphone or an external microphone, such as the one on an Apple headset.

> The above covers the basic concepts of `AVAudioRecorder`. `AVAudioRecorder` supports **unlimited recording duration**, and you can also start recording **from a specific point in the future** or **record for a specified duration**.

Network Streaming
--

The `AVAudioPlayer` audio player can only play local files and loads all audio data at once. But what if we sometimes need to download while listening?
`AVAudioPlayer` does not support playing network streaming audio in this form. To play such network streams, we need to use the audio queue service `Audio Queue Services` from the `AudioToolbox` framework.

__The audio queue service consists of 3 parts:__
> * 3 buffers
> * 1 buffer queue
> * 1 callback

**1. Below is how the audio queue service works for recording:**

![](/assets/images/20170328LearningAVFoundationAVAudioRecorder/QueueServiceRecord.avif)

**2. Below is how the audio queue service works for playback:**

![](/assets/images/20170328LearningAVFoundationAVAudioRecorder/QueueServicePlay.avif)

Of course, we don't need to implement this ourselves in C functions. There's an open-source library [FreeStreamer](https://github.com/sunyazhou13/FreeStreamer).

Using FreeStreamer

``` objc 
#import <FreeStreamer/FreeStreamer.h>

- (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self initAudioStream];
    //Play network streaming audio
    [self.audioStream play];
}
/* Initialize the network streaming object */
- (void)initAudioStream{
    NSString *urlStr = @"http://sc1.111ttt.com/2016/1/02/24/195242042236.mp3";
    NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlStr];
    //Create an FSAudioStream object
    self.audioStream = [[FSAudioStream alloc] initWithUrl:url];
    //Set the playback error callback block
    self.audioStream.onFailure = ^(FSAudioStreamError error, NSString *description){
          NSLog(@"播放过程中发生错误，错误信息：%@",description);
    };
    //Set the completion callback block
    self.audioStream.onCompletion = ^(){
          NSLog(@"播放完成!");
    };
    [self.audioStream setVolume:0.5];//Set the volume
}
```
That's drifting a bit off topic. Let's get back to the main subject. This chapter won't include this in the demo, I hope you'll understand.

Now let's write an `AVAudioRecorder` demo to implement the above features
==

Configuring the Audio Session
--

First, create an AVAudioRecorderDemo project for the iOS platform — I'm sure everyone is very familiar with this.

In `AppDelegate`, import `#import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>` and add the following configuration code:

``` objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    
    AVAudioSession *session = [AVAudioSession sharedInstance];
    NSError *error;
    if (![session setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord error:&error]) {
        NSLog(@"Category Error: %@",[error localizedDescription]);
    }
    
    //Activate the session
    if (![session setActive:YES error:&error]) {
        NSLog(@"Activation Error: %@",[error localizedDescription]);
    }
    
    return YES;
}
```

This `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord` is one of those categories described in the [previous chapter](http://sunyazhou.com/2017/03/17/Learning-AV-Foundation-AVAudioPlayer/). We need the **record + play** functionality.

Next, configure the permission information in the plist file. You can refer to the article [Access privacy-sensitive data](http://localhost:4000/2017/03/20/Access-privacy-sensitive-data-private-access-permission/) and fill in the required access permission information.

![plist1](/assets/images/20170328LearningAVFoundationAVAudioRecorder/FillInfo.avif)

Then choose SourceCode
![plist2](/assets/images/20170328LearningAVFoundationAVAudioRecorder/SourceCode.avif)

And fill in:

``` xml
<!-- 🎤 Microphone -->
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>$(PRODUCT_NAME) microphone use</string>
```
All the above is for local authorization access. Remember that if the authorization is denied on the first attempt, the user must manually go to General - Settings to configure it, otherwise it will never work. If you don't add this local authorization, the app will crash.

Recording Implementation
--

First, let's wrap a class called `BDRecoder`. This class is responsible for all audio recording, pausing, saving recorded files, etc., and exposes callbacks via blocks. `BDRecoder.h` looks like this. In the future, when refining it, we could add a delegate to handle logic such as unexpected interruptions during recording or route switching.

``` objc
//
//  BDRecorder.h
//  AVAudioRecorderDemo
//
//  Created by sunyazhou on 2017/3/29.
//  Copyright © 2017 Baidu, Inc. All rights reserved.
//

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#import <AVFoundation/AVFoundation.h>

@class MemoModel;
//Callback when recording stops
typedef void (^BDRecordingStopCompletionHanlder)(BOOL);
//Callback when saving the recording finishes
typedef void (^BDRecordingSaveCompletionHanlder)(BOOL, id);

@interface BDRecorder : NSObject

/**
 * Get the current recording time externally
 * hours:minutes:seconds  Of course, microseconds and milliseconds can be added later, just a format string like 00:03:02
 */
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *formattedCurrentTime;

- (BOOL)record; //开始录音

- (void)pause;  //暂停录音

- (void)stopWithCompletionHandler:(BDRecordingStopCompletionHanlder)handler;

- (void)saveRecordingWithName:(NSString *)name
            completionHandler:(BDRecordingSaveCompletionHanlder)handler;

/**
 Playback of the recorded file
 
 @param memo the memo model of the file currently being played
 @return whether playback started successfully
 */
- (BOOL)playbackURL:(MemoModel *)memo;
@end

```

`BDRecoder.m`

``` objc
//

#import "MemoModel.h"

@interface BDRecorder () <AVAudioRecorderDelegate>

@property (nonatomic, strong) AVAudioPlayer *player;
@property (nonatomic, strong) AVAudioRecorder *recorder;
@property (nonatomic, strong) BDRecordingStopCompletionHanlder completionHandler;

@end

@implementation BDRecorder

- (instancetype)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        NSString *temDir = NSTemporaryDirectory();
        NSString *filePath = [temDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:@"test1.caf"];
        NSURL *fileURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:filePath];
        
        NSDictionary *setting = @{AVFormatIDKey: @(kAudioFormatAppleIMA4),
                                  AVSampleRateKey: @44100.0f,
                                  AVNumberOfChannelsKey: @1,
                                  AVEncoderBitDepthHintKey: @16,
                                  AVEncoderAudioQualityKey: @(AVAudioQualityMedium)
                                  };
        NSError *error;
        self.recorder = [[AVAudioRecorder alloc] initWithURL:fileURL settings:setting error:&error];
        if (self.recorder) {
            self.recorder.delegate = self;
            [self.recorder prepareToRecord];
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Create Recorder Error: %@",[error localizedDescription]);
        } 
    }
    return self;
}

- (BOOL)record {
    return [self.recorder record];
}

- (void)pause {
    [self.recorder pause];
}

- (void)stopWithCompletionHandler:(BDRecordingStopCompletionHanlder)handler {
    self.completionHandler = handler;
    [self.recorder stop];
}

- (void)saveRecordingWithName:(NSString *)name
            completionHandler:(BDRecordingSaveCompletionHanlder)handler {
    NSTimeInterval timestamp = [NSDate timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate];
    NSString *filename = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@-%f.caf", name, timestamp];
    NSString *docDir = [self documentsDirectory];
    NSString *destPath = [docDir stringByAppendingPathComponent:filename];
    NSURL *srcURL = self.recorder.url;
    NSURL *destURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:destPath];
    NSError *error;
    BOOL success = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] copyItemAtURL:srcURL toURL:destURL error:&error];
    if (success) {
        MemoModel *model = [MemoModel memoWithTitle:name url:destURL];
        handler(YES, model);
    }
    
    
}

- (NSString *)documentsDirectory {
    NSArray *paths = NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES);
    return [paths objectAtIndex:0];
}

- (void)audioRecorderDidFinishRecording:(AVAudioRecorder *)recorder
                           successfully:(BOOL)flag {
    if (self.completionHandler) { self.completionHandler(flag); }
}

@end

```
Here, `self.completionHandler` temporarily stores the block when `stopWithCompletionHandler` is called externally, so that we can notify the outside when recording finishes, allowing a UIAlertView to be shown for saving, etc.

When recording stops and the recording enters the naming stage, let the outside call `saveRecordingWithName:completionHandler` with the file name. We then get the URL from `self.recorder.url` and copy it to the documents directory with the given name.

Next we need to implement `playbackURL:`, which takes a `MemoModel` parameter.
This `MemoModel` is a model object holding the file name, url, etc.

``` objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

@interface MemoModel : NSObject <NSCopying>
@property (copy, nonatomic, readonly) NSString *title;
@property (strong, nonatomic, readonly) NSURL *url;
@property (copy, nonatomic, readonly) NSString *dateString;
@property (copy, nonatomic, readonly) NSString *timeString;

+ (instancetype)memoWithTitle:(NSString *)title url:(NSURL *)url;

- (BOOL)deleteMemo;
@end
//For the concrete implementation, please refer to my final demo
```

To implement the playback part we need to create a player. Here we simply create an `AVAudioPlayer`.

``` objc 
/**
 Playback of the recorded file
 
 @param memo the memo model of the file currently being played
 @return whether playback started successfully
 */
- (BOOL)playbackURL:(MemoModel *)memo {
    [self.player stop];
    self.player = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:memo.url error:nil];
    if (self.player) {
        [self.player prepareToPlay];
        return YES;
    }
    return NO;
}
```

Here we pass `memo.url` to the current player for playback. This is a simple implementation; if you need something more complex, please refer to the `AVAudioPlayer` chapter I explained previously.

Finally, let's add the code for the time display part.

``` objc 
/**
 * Get the current recording time externally
 * hours:minutes:seconds  Of course, microseconds and milliseconds can be added later, just a format string like 00:03:02
 */
@property (nonatomic, readonly) NSString *formattedCurrentTime;

```

Here we need to override the `formattedCurrentTime` getter to obtain a time format such as 00:00:00.

``` objc
/**
 Return the current recording time formatted as HH:mm:ss
 
 @return the assembled string
 */
- (NSString *)formattedCurrentTime {
    NSUInteger time = (NSUInteger)self.recorder.currentTime;
    NSInteger hours = (time / 3600);
    NSInteger minutes = (time / 60) % 60;
    NSInteger seconds = time % 60;
    
    NSString *format = @"%02i:%02i:%02i";
    return [NSString stringWithFormat:format, hours, minutes, seconds];
}
```
That roughly covers the process of wrapping `BDRecorder`.

Below is the UI setup for `ViewController`. After setting up the time format, we need to create a timer in `ViewController` to update the recording time on the UI, because `self.recorder.currentTime` is a read-only property and provides no setter, so we can't observe the recorder's property changes via KVO.

Here's the code:

The code is a bit long, so let me briefly explain it. You can refer to the final demo.

``` objc 
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray <MemoModel *>*memos;
@property (nonatomic, strong) BDRecorder *recorder;

```
Declare an array to hold the model objects to be played, including name, file URL, date, etc.

``` objc
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSTimer *timer;
@property (nonatomic, strong) CADisplayLink *levelTimer;
```

One timer is used to refresh the recording time.
`levelTimer` is used to refresh the waveform display, also known as `Audio Metering`, to meter the audio.

In `BDRecorder`, we added:

``` objc
- (LevelPair *)levels {
    [self.recorder updateMeters];
    float avgPower = [self.recorder averagePowerForChannel:0];
    float peakPower = [self.recorder peakPowerForChannel:0];
    float linearLevel = [self.meterTable valueForPower:avgPower];
    float linearPeak = [self.meterTable valueForPower:peakPower];
    return [LevelPair levelsWithLevel:linearLevel peakLevel:linearPeak];
}
```
These two methods
       1. averagePowerForChannel retrieves the average trough value
       2. peakPowerForChannel retrieves the peak value
Both methods return a floating-point value representing the sound level in decibels (dB). The range of this value is `0dB(fullscale) ~ -160dB`, where 0dB is the maximum and -160dB is the minimum.

**Enabling audio metering (need to enable it in `BDRecorder`, as shown below) brings some extra overhead, but I think it's worth it, since showing visual effects is what matters most.
If `meteringEnabled` is enabled, the audio recorder will compute decibel values for the captured audio samples.**

**How to enable Audio Metering:**

``` objc
self.recorder.meteringEnabled = YES;
```

Before updating, we call the following code:

``` objc 
- (LevelPair *)levels {
    [self.recorder updateMeters];
    ...
}
```

Each time before reading values, you need to call `[self.recorder updateMeters]` to get the latest values; otherwise the values may not be accurate enough.

Then, using the `valueForPower:` method declared by the `MeterTable` class, we convert the two thresholds above into linear values.

**That is, the decibel values are converted from the logarithmic range of `-160 ~ 0` to a linear range of 0 to 1.**

#import "MeterTable.h"


#define MIN_DB -60.0f
#define TABLE_SIZE 300

@implementation MeterTable {
    float _scaleFactor;
    NSMutableArray *_meterTable;
}

- (id)init {
    self = [super init];
    if (self) {
        float dbResolution = MIN_DB / (TABLE_SIZE - 1);
        
        _meterTable = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:TABLE_SIZE];
        _scaleFactor = 1.0f / dbResolution;
        
        float minAmp = dbToAmp(MIN_DB);
        float ampRange = 1.0 - minAmp;
        float invAmpRange = 1.0 / ampRange;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < TABLE_SIZE; i++) {
            float decibels = i * dbResolution;
            float amp = dbToAmp(decibels);
            float adjAmp = (amp - minAmp) * invAmpRange;
            _meterTable[i] = @(adjAmp);
        }
    }
    return self;
}

float dbToAmp(float dB) {
    return powf(10.0f, 0.05f * dB);
}

- (float)valueForPower:(float)power {
    if (power < MIN_DB) {
        return 0.0f;
    } else if (power >= 0.0f) {
        return 1.0f;
    } else {
        int index = (int) (power * _scaleFactor);
        return [_meterTable[index] floatValue];
    }
}

@end

```

> **This class creates an array `_meterTable` that stores the conversion results from the decibel values before calculation to those resolved at a certain decibel resolution. The resolution used here is `-0.2dB`. The resolution level can be modified via the two macros `MIN_DB` and `TABLE_SIZE`. Each decibel value is converted to a linear-range value by calling `dbToAmp:`, placing it within the range `0(-60dB) ~ 1()`. These range values then form a parallel curve, computed with square root and stored in an internal lookup table. Later, if needed externally, you can retrieve it by calling `valueForPower:`.**



Then it is saved to an instance of `LevelPair` and returned. This instance is very simple — it stores two values, one `level` and one `peakLevel`.

``` objc 
@interface LevelPair : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, readonly) float level;
@property (nonatomic, readonly) float peakLevel;

+ (instancetype)levelsWithLevel:(float)level peakLevel:(float)peakLevel;

- (instancetype)initWithLevel:(float)level peakLevel:(float)peakLevel;

@end
```

In `ViewController`, the related UI is displayed:

``` objc
- (void)startTimer {
    [self.timer invalidate];
    self.timer = [NSTimer timerWithTimeInterval:0.5
                                         target:self
                                       selector:@selector(updateTimeDisplay)
                                       userInfo:nil
                                        repeats:YES];
    [[NSRunLoop mainRunLoop] addTimer:self.timer forMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes];
}

- (void)stopTimer {
    [self.timer invalidate];
    self.timer = nil;
}

- (void)updateTimeDisplay {
    self.timeLabel.text = self.recorder.formattedCurrentTime;
}

- (void)startMeterTimer {
    [self.levelTimer invalidate];
    self.levelTimer = [CADisplayLink displayLinkWithTarget:self selector:@selector(updateMeter)];
//    if ([self.levelTimer respondsToSelector:@selector(setPreferredFramesPerSecond:)]) {
//        self.levelTimer.preferredFramesPerSecond = 5;
//    } else {
    self.levelTimer.frameInterval = 5;
//    }
    [self.levelTimer addToRunLoop:[NSRunLoop currentRunLoop]
                          forMode:NSRunLoopCommonModes];
    
}


- (void)stopMeterTimer {
    [self.levelTimer invalidate];
    self.levelTimer = nil;
    [self.levelMeterView resetLevelMeter];
}

- (void)updateMeter {
    LevelPair *levels = [self.recorder levels];
    self.levelMeterView.level = levels.level;
    self.levelMeterView.peakLevel = levels.peakLevel;
    [self.levelMeterView setNeedsDisplay];
    
}

```
This handles the timers.

Event handling:

``` objc
#pragma mark - event response 所有触发的事件响应 按钮、通知、分段控件等
- (IBAction)record:(UIButton *)sender {
    self.stopButton.enabled = YES;
    if ([sender isSelected]) {
        [self stopMeterTimer];
        [self stopTimer];
        [self.recorder pause];
    } else {
        [self startMeterTimer];
        [self startTimer];
        [self.recorder record];
    }
    [sender setSelected:![sender isSelected]];
}

- (IBAction)stopRecording:(UIButton *)sender {
    [self stopMeterTimer];
    self.recordButton.selected = NO;
    self.stopButton.enabled = NO;
    [self.recorder stopWithCompletionHandler:^(BOOL result) {
        double delayInSeconds = 0.01;
        dispatch_time_t popTime = dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t) (delayInSeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC));
        dispatch_after(popTime, dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            [self showSaveDialog];
        });
    }];
}

```

Here the data is saved using archiving.

`BDRecorder` doesn't handle unexpected interruptions, such as external microphones or unexpected incoming calls. If you need to handle these, you can declare a few delegates in `BDRecorder` to listen to the audio session notifications. Since this is for learning purposes, I'll stop here. If there's strong demand, I'll follow up and make it open source.

Many people struggle with how to draw a better waveform. I used the demo from the book's author to implement the waveform rendering view.

Here we've given the thresholds for level and peak. There are many open-source views from third parties you can research on your own. It's quite simple — it's just the process of quantifying the relevant thresholds.
