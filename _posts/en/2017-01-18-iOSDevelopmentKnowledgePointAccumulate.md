> I've been working on iOS development for a long time. In the past, I used my brain to memorize technical articles and the code of technical implementations. But when a person's brain exceeds a certain storage limit, stack overflow occurs (actually, I'm just not that smart). Later, I gradually started to remember which blog was written by whom, or the code of how a technique was implemented... But then I found that not only was the stack overflowing, the heap could barely hold the vast number of iOS technical articles anymore... Sigh. So I kept all the classic article bookmarks and browser URLs in my Chrome. Now I want to organize them and put them in my blog, to make it easy to look up the code of a certain technical implementation (in fact, even my former intern colleagues at Baidu Cloud were amazed at how I could store a certain technique in such detail). OK, let's start the iOS knowledge point technical navigation.

The iOS technical categories are as follows:

* Audio
* Camera & Photos
* Graphics & Images
* Animation
* UI Transitions
* ASDK (AsyncDisplayKit)
* Swift-related
* Math & Graphics
* Architecture
* Masonry
* CocoaPods
* File-related

Transition Animation

__[WWDC 2013 Session Notes - ViewController Transitions in iOS 7]()__ This post by 喵神 is a must-read

__[UIPresentationController Tutorial: Getting Started](https://www.raywenderlich.com/139277/uipresentationcontroller-tutorial-getting-started)__ requires a VPN (翻墙)  
*(By the way, let me explain the term "翻墙" (climbing the wall). The formal term for it is 科学上网 (scientific internet access); in slang it's called 自备梯子 (bring your own ladder), because at first everyone used [云梯VPN](https://www.yuntipub.com/) to access foreign websites. Our country set up a huge local-area network behind a crappy firewall. Although it has hindered the development of world civilization and technology, it also blocks some unhealthy content — for instance, what if one day you build a lathe and make a submachine gun, haha. So getting over that firewall is commonly known as "翻墙" (wall climbing).)*

> Here I want to share my views on ASDK. I've tried to read the source code and the official documentation, and I found that this is not something you can just start using right away. It's almost like having a beginner learn **UIKit** all over again — integration is quite simple, but just the layout system alone is enough for a developer to study for a while, and you can't use Masonry with it. However, for a page with simple functionality that needs performance tuning, it's worth considering.






Swift-related

__[喵神's website](http://swifter.tips/)__ It seems to have stopped updating. In the iOS development field, 喵神 is truly a god-like presence.  
__[Swift Random Numbers](http://southpeak.github.io/2015/09/26/ios-techset-5/)__ from __[南峰子 老驴](http://southpeak.github.io/)__, a former Baidu colleague who now works at JD Finance, I believe. I've had technical exchanges with him; a really impressive guy.

Math & Graphics

Architecture
--
__[Casa's Blog](http://casatwy.com/)__

> I have to comment on this Casa guy. He's the only iOS architect I truly admire. In my words, this is what a real architect in a programmer's mind looks like, not those so-called architects who merely sound impressive. When I worked at Baidu Cloud (the one you see as Baidu Netdisk), there was a T8 architect sitting right across from me. That architect was so idle every day that I really wanted to kick his ass. He modified the iOS program without even removing the xib references, which eventually caused a crash in production. I actually really want to give him a piece of advice: no matter how awesome your skills are, you should keep writing code every day. Remember the words of Confucius: 『吾尝终日而思矣，不如须臾之所学也』(I once spent all day pondering, but it wasn't as good as a moment of learning).  
> This Casa guy showed me what an architecture engineer and a business engineer are. He's someone who can truly write architecture code and then throw it to the business engineers, saying: follow this approach.
