## Problem Description

These past few days I wanted to align my code and found that the XAlign plugin I often use had stopped working. Looking at the settings, I saw that Xcode Source Editor was missing from the extensions.

After searching online, I found a reliable solution, so I'm jotting it down here.

Enter the following in the terminal and it will show up:

``` sh
$ PATH=/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Support:"$PATH"
$ lsregister -f /Applications/Xcode.app
```

The cause

When multiple copies of Xcode are on the same machine, extensions may stop working entirely. In this case, Apple Developer Relations suggests re-registering your primary copy of Xcode with Launch Services (the easiest way is to temporarily add lsregister's location to PATH):
