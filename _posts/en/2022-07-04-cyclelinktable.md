# Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list `head`, determine whether the linked list has a cycle in it.

If there is a node in the linked list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer, then the linked list has a cycle. To represent a cycle in the given linked list, the judge system internally uses the integer `pos` to denote the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where the tail connects to.

> Note: `pos` is not passed as a parameter. It is only used to identify the actual situation of the linked list.

Return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1

![](/assets/images/20220704CycleLinkTable/1.avif)

``` sh 
输入：head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
输出：true
解释：链表中有一个环，其尾部连接到第二个节点。
```

#### Example 2

![](/assets/images/20220704CycleLinkTable/2.avif)

``` sh 
输入：head = [1,2], pos = 0
输出：true
解释：链表中有一个环，其尾部连接到第一个节点。
```

#### Example 3

![](/assets/images/20220704CycleLinkTable/3.avif)

``` sh 
输入：head = [1], pos = -1
输出：false
解释：链表中没有环。
```

## Implementation

``` c++
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
};

class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        unordered_set<ListNode *> seen;
        while (head != nullptr) {
            if (seen.count(head)){
                return true;
            } 
            seen.insert(head);
            head = head->next;
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
