## Preface

Having seen countless times how people always create files using a `timestamp + arc4random()`, I felt deeply frustrated. Doesn't the operating system provide a relevant function? So I found the following code to deal with filename conflicts when creating files.


``` objc
/* Create a recording file */
    NSString *filePath = [@"~/Movies/AVScreenShackRecording_XXXXXX" stringByStandardizingPath];
    char *screenRecordingFileName = strdup([filePath fileSystemRepresentation]);
    if (screenRecordingFileName)
    {
        int fileDescriptor = mkstemp(screenRecordingFileName);
        if (fileDescriptor != -1)
        {
            NSString *filenameStr = [[NSFileManager defaultManager] stringWithFileSystemRepresentation:screenRecordingFileName length:strlen(screenRecordingFileName)];
            
            NSLog(@"唯一的文件名:%@",filenameStr);
            
        }
        remove(screenRecordingFileName);
        free(screenRecordingFileName);
    }
```

*__Remember that the file suffix needs to include `XXXXXX`__* — each `X` represents one character of `digits + letters`
*Note*: It's best to use 6 X's or more. [See Linux reference](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mkstemp.3.html)

The key is to understand the following two functions:

[strdup() is a commonly used string copy function in C](http://baike.baidu.com/item/strdup/5522525)

[mkstemp() creates and opens a file with a unique filename in the system](http://baike.baidu.com/link?url=wFhfkOVXafm15-4vGfxEQiQynIG7BG2yYAurwzS4uHKmby2C2lfhiO2T6WAqbdc3nOP9mEOVTMaBqxOc2eZps7_JIAsIWI0p11pEIl7Vku_)


OK, hope this helps
