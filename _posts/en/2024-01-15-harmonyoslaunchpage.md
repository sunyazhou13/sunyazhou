## HarmonyOS Development

In 2024, technology can't just stay on our lips — actions speak louder than words. After a few months of learning HarmonyOS development, I feel I should record the easily forgotten content. Today, the first simple code I bring is the entry-level piece of HarmonyOS development: building a simple splash screen.


### First, Let's See the Result

![launch](/assets/images/20240115HarmonyOSLaunchPage/launch.avif)

### The Environment Used Here Is HarmonyOS 4.1

Here's the code:

``` ts
import router from '@ohos.router'

@Entry
@Component
struct Index {
  onPageShow() {
    setTimeout(()=> {
      console.log("闪屏1s结束")
      router.pushUrl({
        url:'pages/Home'
      })
    }, 3000)
  }

  build() {
    Flex({
      direction: FlexDirection.Column,
      alignItems: ItemAlign.Center,
      justifyContent: FlexAlign.Center
    }) {
      Image($r("app.media.sunyazhou"))
        .width(100)
        .height(100)
      Text("迈腾大队长")
        .fontSize(26)
        .fontColor(Color.White)
        .margin({top: 300})
      Text("SUNYAZHOU.COM 版权所有")
        .fontSize(16)
        .textAlign(TextAlign.Center)
        .fontColor(Color.White)
        .margin({top: 10})
    }
    .width('100%')
    .height('100%')
    .backgroundColor('#66CDAA')
  }
}
```

The basic code to enter the home page:

``` ts  
@Entry
@Component
struct Home {
  build() {
    Column(){
      Text("Home首页")
        .fontSize(26)
        .fontColor(Color.White)
        .margin({top: 300})
    }.width('100%').height('100%').backgroundColor('#00FFFF')
  }
}
```

In the code above, the important part is the `setTimeout` function in `onPageShow()`. This function has a built-in timer; 3000 means 3 seconds, i.e., after 3 seconds the router directly navigates to the Home page.

Here a Flex layout is used:

* direction: FlexDirection.Column,
* alignItems: ItemAlign.Center,
* justifyContent: FlexAlign.Center

These three represent the Flex main axis direction, the content alignment direction, and the cross axis direction respectively. If you don't understand, please refer to the [Huawei Developer Documentation](https://developer.harmonyos.com/cn/develop/).

# Summary

Today's article briefly introduces the simple development of a launch splash screen. You can build on this for ad and launch page configurations. More complex content is left for future exploration. Thanks for watching.
