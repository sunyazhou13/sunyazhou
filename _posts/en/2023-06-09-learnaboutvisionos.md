## Getting to Know visionOS

visionOS can be understood as a new iOS-like system that runs on Apple's headset. In Apple's own words, it's all sorts of highfalutin "spatial technology" and so on. It makes use of the SwiftUI, UIKit, RealityKit, and ARKit frameworks. If you want to develop apps for visionOS, it's best to have experience with these various kits; if you don't, I'd still encourage you to learn them, or simply start with SwiftUI.

* SwiftUI is like the UIKit of before — a new UI framework system for building UI, used for Swift development
* UIKit is the original Objective-C UI system
* RealityKit is the augmented reality framework
* ARKit is the virtual reality framework

## spatial computing

Learn the building blocks of spatial computing — windows, volumes, and spaces — and find out how to use these elements to build engaging immersive experiences. We'll walk you through the frameworks used to create apps for visionOS and show you how to design for depth, scale, and immersion. Explore how to use tools from Apple like Xcode and the new Reality Composer Pro, and how to make spatial computing apps that work for everyone.

*  windows — this thing is important: it's just like the window we used for UIView and the like, generally a 2D content view container
*  volumes — an expanded, enhanced container on top of windows, for holding both 2D and 3D content
*  spaces — like the camera, that is, the position of our own eyes; a type used for passthrough, full-screen, and large curved 3D display modes

The official explanations are as follows:

* windows
You can create one or more windows in your visionOS app. They're built with SwiftUI, contain traditional views and controls, and you can add depth to the experience by adding 3D content.

* volumes
Add depth to your app with a 3D volume. Volumes are SwiftUI scenes that can use RealityKit or Unity to present 3D content, creating experiences viewable from any angle in the Shared Space or an app's Full Space.
* spaces
By default, apps launch into the Shared Space, where they exist side by side, like multiple apps on a Mac desktop. Apps can use windows and volumes to display content, and people can reposition these elements wherever they like. For a more immersive experience, an app can open a dedicated Full Space that shows only that app's content. In a Full Space, an app can use windows and volumes, create unbounded 3D content, open portals to different worlds, and even place people fully inside an environment.

Learn the building blocks of spatial computing — windows, volumes, and spaces — and find out how to use these elements to build engaging immersive experiences. We'll walk you through the frameworks used to create apps for visionOS and show you how to design for depth, scale, and immersion. Explore how to use tools from Apple like Xcode and the new Reality Composer Pro, and how to make spatial computing apps that work for everyone.

Here are four videos for learning about this:

![](/assets/images/20230609LearnAboutVisionOS/MeetSpatialComputing1.avif)

* [Get started with building apps for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10260/)
* [Principles of spatial design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10072/)
* [Create accessible spatial experiences](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10034/)
* [Develop your first immersive app](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10203/)

Once you're familiar with the basics of visionOS, take a deeper look at the frameworks that support the platform. Tour SwiftUI for visionOS, learn how to add depth to windows and volumes, and how to use a Full Space to let people experience your app in ways never possible before. We'll also introduce you to UIKit for spatial computing and share how to use it alongside SwiftUI.

![](/assets/images/20230609LearnAboutVisionOS/MeetSpatialComputing2.avif)

[Meet SwiftUI for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10109/)
[Meet UIKit for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/111215/)

These two are about UIKit and SwiftKit

## Exploring SwiftUI and RealityKit

To go deeper into SwiftUI and RealityKit, explore the dedicated series of sessions focused on SwiftUI scene types that help you build great experiences across windows, volumes, and spaces. Learn about the Model 3D API, find out how to add depth and dimension to your app, and learn how to render 3D content with RealityView. We'll help you get ready to step into ImmersiveSpace — a new SwiftUI scene type that lets you create great immersive experiences for visionOS. Learn best practices for managing scene types, add immersion, and build an out-of-this-world experience.

* [Elevate your windowed app for spatial computing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10110/)
* [Take SwiftUI to the next dimension](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10113/)
* [Go beyond the window with SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10111/)

In our second series, learn how to bring engaging immersive content to your app with RealityKit. Get started with RealityKit entities, components, and systems, and learn how to add 3D models and effects to a project. We'll show you how to embed your content into an entity hierarchy, blend virtual content with the real world using anchors, bring particle effects into your app, add video content, and create even more immersive experiences through portals.

* [Build spatial experiences with RealityKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10080/)

## Rediscovering ARKit

Finally, we'll help you understand ARKit on visionOS. The platform uses ARKit algorithms to handle features like persistence, world mapping, segmentation, person occlusion, and environmental lighting. These algorithms run continuously, allowing apps and games to automatically benefit from ARKit in the Shared Space. Once your app opens a dedicated Full Space, it can take advantage of ARKit APIs and blend virtual content with the real world.

We'll share how this framework has been completely reimagined to let you build interactive experiences while protecting privacy. Learn how to make 3D content that interacts with someone's room — whether you want to bounce a virtual ball off the floor or throw virtual paint on a wall. Explore the latest updates to the ARKit APIs, and follow along as we demonstrate how to take advantage of hand tracking and scene geometry in your app.

## Collaboration, Sharing, and Productivity

Sharing and collaboration are a core part of visionOS, offering experiences in apps and games that make people feel as though they're in the same space together. By default, people can share any app window with others over FaceTime, just like on a Mac. But when you adopt the GroupActivities framework, you can create the next generation of collaborative experiences.

Get started designing and building SharePlay on Apple Vision Pro by learning about the types of shared activities you can create in your app. Find out how to establish a shared context between participants in an experience, and learn how to support more meaningful interactions in your app by supporting spatial Personas.
