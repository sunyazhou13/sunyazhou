## Background

While studying the GPU shader programming chapter of "Metal", I came across a section about the argument buffer of the GPU resource heap, which needs to send resources from the CPU to the GPU. There I encountered a piece of code that calculates the memory footprint of a resource. It's quite interesting, so I'm writing it down here.

``` swift
let sizeAndAligns = descriptors.map { descriptor in
    Renderer.device.heapTextureSizeAndAlign(descriptor: descriptor)
}
heapDescriptor.size = sizeAndAligns.reduce(0) { total, sizeAndAlign in
    let size = sizeAndAlign.size
    let align = sizeAndAlign.align
    return total + size - (size & (align - 1)) + align   //这行代码
}
if heapDescriptor.size == 0 {
    return nil
}
```

The documentation explains it like this

> You calculate the size of the heap using size and correct alignment within the heap.
As long as align is a power of two, (size & (align - 1)) will give you the
remainder when size is divided by alignment. For example, if you have a size of 129
bytes, and you want to align it to memory blocks of 128 bytes, this is the result of
size - (size & (align - 1)) + align:

``` sh
129 - (129 & (128 - 1)) + 128 = 256
```

The expression `129 & (128 - 1)` is essentially an efficient modulo (remainder) operation, but it only holds when the divisor is a power of two. Here is a detailed explanation:

#### 1. Mathematical Principle

When align is a power of two (e.g., 128 = 2⁷), the binary form of align - 1 is all 1s (for example, the binary of 127 is 01111111).
The bitwise AND (&) operation clears the high bits of size, keeping only the value of the low log₂(align) bits, which is the remainder of size % align.

Example calculation
For size = 129, align = 128:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{余数} &= 129 \ \% \ 128 \\
&= 129 \ \& \ (128 - 1) \\
&= 129 \ \& \ 127 \\
&= \text{二进制} \ 10000001 \ \& \ 01111111 \\
&= 00000001 \quad (\text{即十进制 1})
\end{align*}
$$

#### 2. Comparison with Traditional Modulo Operation


| Method | Expression | Result |	Applicable Condition
| ------| ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| Bitwise AND method | `size & (align - 1)`	 |  1	 | `align` must be a power of two |
| Traditional modulo method	 | `size % align` |  1 |  Any positive integer |

Advantages

* High performance: The hardware execution speed of bitwise operations (&) is usually an order of magnitude faster than modulo operations (%).
* Concise code: Suitable for scenarios that require frequent alignment calculations (such as GPU memory management).

#### 3. Practical Use Cases

When managing heap memory (`MTLHeap`) in Metal, this method is commonly used to calculate the aligned memory size. For example:

``` swift
func alignedSize(size: Int, align: Int) -> Int {
    assert(align.isPowerOfTwo, "Alignment must be a power of two")
    let remainder = size & (align - 1)
    return remainder == 0 ? size : (size - remainder + align)
}

// Example: align 129 bytes to 128 bytes
let aligned = alignedSize(size: 129, align: 128) // 结果为 256
```

#### 4. What If align Is Not a Power of Two?

If `align` is not a power of two (e.g., `align = 100`), the traditional modulo operation must be used:

``` swift
func alignedSizeGeneric(size: Int, align: Int) -> Int {
    let remainder = size % align
    return remainder == 0 ? size : (size - remainder + align)
}

// Example: align 250 to 100
let aligned = alignedSizeGeneric(size: 250, align: 100) // 结果为 300
```

Yes, the expression `129 & (128 - 1)` is essentially an efficient modulo (remainder) operation, but it **only holds when the divisor is a power of two**.

### **Summary**
- `129 & (128 - 1)` **is a modulo operation**, but it only holds when `align` is a power of two.
- **Use cases**: GPU memory alignment, optimizing modulo operations in high-performance computing.
- **Core formula**:  
	
$$
\text{AlignedSize} = \text{size} - (\text{size} \ \% \ \text{align}) + \text{align}
$$

Where `%` can be optimized with `& (align - 1)` (when `align` is a power of two).
