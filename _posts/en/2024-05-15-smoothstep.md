# How do you keep a value inside a range?

## In everyday development we often need to clamp values, like this:

``` c
float a = 某个输入值
float maxValue = 1;
//check  0 < a < the limit, assuming maxValue = 1

if (a <= 0) {
	a = 0;
} else if (a >= maxValue) {
	a = maxValue	
}

return a;

```

This is the kind of code I wrote when I was first learning C.

## Years later, this is how I write it

``` c
//Include the standard library header; the import statement is omitted here...

float a = 某个输入值
float maxValue = 1;
//Elegance never goes out of style
float a = min(max(0, a), maxValue); // 0 <= a <= 1
return a;
```

One line, and it reads much better — the value is clamped between min and max.

I once asked all the senior engineers at my previous company:

**Is there a function that combines min + max to clamp a value within a certain range?**

Most of them didn't know.

## smoothstep() — the Hermite smooth interpolation function

Years later, though, I discovered my version wasn't the last word either. The standard library is full of functions you only find once you go looking.

While reading `Metal by Tutorials`, a fragment shader snippet caught my eye.

``` txt
“smoothstep

smoothstep(edge0, edge1, x) returns a smooth Hermite interpolation between 0 and 1.


Note: edge1 must be greater than edge0, and x should be edge0 <= x <= edge1.”

Here's the fragment shader code:

``` c
float color = smoothstep(0, params.width, in.position.x);
return float4(color, color, color, 1);

```

So the function I'd been using all these years actually has a name: `smoothstep`.

# Summary

The natural next step: wrap `smoothstep()` in a global inline helper.

``` c
inline xx_smoothstep(T minEdge, T maxEdge, value) {
	return smoothstep(minEdge, maxEdge, value); 
}

```

That handles every range-clamping case in real-world code. It turns out what I'd been chasing all these years wasn't fancier techniques — it was simply knowing the right tool exists.
