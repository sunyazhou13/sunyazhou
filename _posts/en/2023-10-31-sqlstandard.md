## Background

I've been too busy with work lately to keep up with blog output. Today I have some spare time to discuss an article I recently read.

[Orona technical topic — Time-Series Data Analysis](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/CMgxtw0AisqtNeY1gRgJsQ) is from the NetEase Cloud Music technical team. The article briefly describes big-data work on data statistics, but that's not the focus of my introduction today. What I want to focus on is the SQL statements used in that article.

When I was in college, the SQL our teacher taught us seemed practical and simple at the time. But it overlooked something very important: uniform code style, code standards, and conventions.

Now, looking at the article from NetEase Cloud Music, I observed the SQL statements:

``` sql
SELECT toStartOfDay(time), avg(degree)
FROM table_temperature
WHERE
    time>='2023-09-01' AND
    time<'2023-10-01' AND
    city='杭州'
GROUP BY toStartOfDay(time)
```

Continuing to observe:

``` sql
SELECT toYear(time), model, avg(price)
FROM table_gas
WHERE
    time>='2013-01-01' AND
    time<'2023-01-01'
GROUP BY toYear(time), model
```

I suddenly felt this style was something I had to record — it's really standard.

``` sql
CREATE CONTINUE QUERY "cq_event" ON "apm_log"
BEGIN
  SELECT SUM("pv") as pv
  INTO "one_year"."cq_hour_event"
  FROM "one_week"."cq_minute_event"
  GROUP BY time(1h), *
END
```

And also this:

``` sql
SELECT
   TUMBLE_START(PROCTIME(), INTERVAL '1' MINUTE) as wTime,
   count(os) as pv,
   os as osName,
   moduleName as moduleName
FROM performance_log
WHERE
    props['mspm'] = 'ReactNativeApplication'
GROUP BY
    TUMBLE(PROCTIME(), INTERVAL '1' MINUTE),
    os,
    props['moduleName']
```

You get the idea.

#### Creating a table

``` sql
CREATE TABLE rn_monitor_cold_boot_stage_local
(
    `appName` String, -- 应用名，如 云音乐
    `osName` String, -- 操作系统名
    `appVersion` String, -- 应用版本
    `rnModuleName` String, -- ReactNative 模块名
    `deviceTag` String, -- 设备性能分档
    `uploadTime` DateTime, -- 日志到达服务端时间
    `uid` String, -- 用户 uid
    `stageName` String, -- 阶段名
    `stageCost` Float32, -- 阶段耗时
)
ENGINE = MergeTree
PARTITION BY (appName, osName, toYYYYMMDD(uploadTime))
ORDER BY (rnModuleName, uploadTime)
TTL uploadTime + toIntervalDay(90)
SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192, use_minimalistic_part_header_in_zookeeper = 1
```

#### Querying a table

``` sql
SELECT
 toStartOfDay(uploadTime) as "time",
 avg(stageCost) AS "avg",
 quantiles(0.5, 0.9)(stageCost) AS "quantiles",
 count() AS "pv",
 uniq(uid) AS "uv"
FROM rn_monitor_cold_boot_stage_shard
WHERE
   uploadTime>=1682006400 AND
   uploadTime<=1682611199 AND
   stageName='render' AND
   rnModuleName='rn-playlistrank'
GROUP BY toStartOfDay(uploadTime)
ORDER BY toStartOfDay(uploadTime) ASC
```

I wonder if everyone has actually observed:

* 1. Keywords on their own line
* 2. Parentheses on their own line and aligned
* 3. Each field on its own line, separated by `,` commas
* 4. Start and end paired up
* 5. Keywords must be at the front, aligned with the first line
* 6. Keywords like `AND` and `ASC` at the end

My summary may be a bit scattered, but based on the standard style above, I naively believe this is what SQL should look like. SQL should be written this way to give others better readability.


# Summary

Today I briefly introduced the standard way of writing SQL. For people who work with databases often, this may be nothing special — everyone might think they know it and only I didn't, finding me ridiculous. Regardless, this is my accumulation of knowledge and the continuous improvement of my own understanding. I wrote this article to record these good code examples.
