# Preface

Recently the company issued a new MacBook Pro to me, and after a lot of fiddling I found that my original software couldn't be migrated over, or was too troublesome to migrate. Hence this article.


## Background

Since Mac disk space is limited, I have to resort to third-party software to clean up the disk. Especially for an iOS developer, with a 128G SSD Mac, all I can say is the company is too stingy. It's barely enough to install Xcode for work; as for the rest, I think my 256G iPhone X is more than enough to handle.


Xcode is the app that takes up the most space on a Mac — it ranks first in memory, disk I/O, and system resources. Since I always run on a real device, Xcode's built-in simulator is of no use and also takes up some disk space. A few years ago, there was this software on the cover called Cleaner For Xcode.

It's open source and written in React Native. I find it quite useful. But this developer isn't very decent — he priced it at $0.99 on the Mac App Store.


Seriously, I say this author is really not decent. If you're going to open source it, why not build a release package for all the Mac folks to use? So today, since I had some time, I set up the RN environment and swore to compile an app **for free** for everyone to use.


## The Process

Honestly, I really didn't want to install RN — it wastes too much disk space and time. But I had no choice. After a lot of fiddling, I ran into many pitfalls.


#### Pitfall-Filling Experience

RN versions above 0.45 require the boost library. Even downloading this library behind the wall was a huge pain... Done.

Then I had to install yarn, node, npm, watchdog... Done.

Compilation errors, Xcode 10.12.1 (the latest at the time), various compile options, static analysis. Done.



After about 30 minutes, I finally cobbled together an app.

Take it, everyone, no need to be polite.


Actually, this is just about understanding what caches are stored in each Xcode directory, deleting them now and then, and making a nice-looking UI. The author is kind of crazy — such a simple feature could be done with a shell script or a few lines of Objective-C, but he had to go to all the trouble of using RN. And then open sourcing it without even being decent about it. Developers like this are really infuriating.
