# The Standard Way to Write HitTest


``` objc
- (UIView *)hitTest:(CGPoint)point withEvent:(UIEvent *)event
{
    if (!self.isUserInteractionEnabled || self.isHidden || self.alpha <= 0.01)
    {
        return nil;
    }
    if ([self pointInside:point withEvent:event])
    {
        for (UIView *subview in [self.subviews reverseObjectEnumerator])
        {
            CGPoint convertedPoint = [subview convertPoint:point fromView:self];
            UIView *hitTestView = [subview hitTest:convertedPoint withEvent:event];
            if (hitTestView)
            {
                if (hitTestView.superview == self)
                {
                    // None of self's subviews should respond to events
                    return nil;
                }
                return hitTestView;
            }
        }
        return nil;
    }
    return nil;
}
```
