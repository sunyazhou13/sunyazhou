## jekyll 

My blog started with Hexo. Later, [`OneV's Den`](https://onevcat.com/) switched his blog to Jekyll, and I really liked it. But with Hexo, writing a post was straightforward — you could just use

``` sh
hexo new "202300202XXXPaper"

```
in this form, generating a markdown file from a template.

> For the specific usage, take a look at the [Hexo commands](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/docs/commands.html)


However, in OneV's Den's simplified version of the new [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/ theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/), it's still fairly simple and practical, except that it lacks a way to quickly write posts.

After emailing OneV's Den to ask,

he not only replied, but also said he doesn't write posts very often — he just copies an old one, which isn't much trouble. At the end of the email, he gave a very practical Stack Overflow answer.

In my blog, there's a `Gemfile` file.

``` sh
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "jekyll", ">=3.8.6"

# Official Plugins
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-paginate"
  gem "jekyll-redirect-from"
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag", "~> 2.6.1"
  gem 'jekyll-compose' //新增这个
end

group :test do
  gem "html-proofer"
end

```

Then run it once.

``` sh
bundle install
```
This ensures all the required libraries are loaded. Here you can configure the Ruby China mirror or use a proxy.

What's left is running this every time you publish a post:

``` sh
$ bundle exec jekyll post "My New Post"
```

> Don't copy the `$` symbol — it just means this is a command you run in your shell terminal.

After generation, it automatically formats the year-month structure.

``` sh
bundle exec jekyll post "jekyllpost"
```

### A Question

The markdown generated here doesn't allow the same customization as Hexo's template. I haven't found a way. If you're interested, we can research it together.

[Why isn't there a "jekyll post" command to create posts like in hexo?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43416113/why-isnt-there-a-jekyll-post-command-to-create-posts-like-in-hexo)

# Summary

This command-line tool is very well suited to someone like me who publishes posts frequently. I hope it helps friends using Jekyll.
