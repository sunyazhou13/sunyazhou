# The do-catch Statement in Swift

In Swift, the `do-catch` statement is a mechanism for error handling. It allows you to execute code that might throw errors (in the `do` block) and catch those errors (in the `catch` block) for handling. This is an elegant way to handle runtime errors in Swift.

## Example


```swift
do {
    // Code to try executing, which might throw an error here
    let number = "这不是一个数字"
    let myNumber = Int(number) // This line might throw an error due to conversion failure
    
    // If the above code doesn't throw an error, the code here will execute
    print("转换成功: \(myNumber)")
} catch let error as NSError {
    // Catch and handle the error
    print("发生错误: \(error.localizedDescription)")
}
```

## Explanation

1. **do block**
   - In the `do` block, you place code that might throw errors.
   - The example tries to convert a string `"这不是一个数字"` to `Int` type, which typically fails and throws an error.

2. **catch block**
   - The `catch` block follows immediately after the `do` block.
   - It is used to catch errors thrown in the `do` block.
   - You can catch different types of errors based on their specific types (through pattern matching). In the example, we catch all errors that conform to the `NSError` type.
   - Once an error is caught, you can write code in the `catch` block to handle it.

## Notes

- Starting from Swift 2, the use of `NSError` was replaced by Swift's error handling mechanism, but it's still used in the example because it demonstrates how to catch and handle errors.
- In the latest Swift versions, you're more likely to see error handling using the `Error` protocol instead of `NSError`.

## Simplified catch Block

```swift
do {
    // Code to try executing
} catch {
    // Catch all errors
    print("发生错误")
}
```

In this simplified version, we don't specify a particular error type, so it catches any type of error thrown in the `do` block.

# Summary

I encountered previously forgotten content while working on a Metal learning demo, so I'm recording it here.

``` swift
do {
	pipelineState = try device.makeRenderPipelineState(descriptor: pipelineDescriptor)
} catch {
  	fatalError(error.localizedDescription)
}
```
