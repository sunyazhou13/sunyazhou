First post of 2021, recording a time-consuming problem encountered during development.

### Solving the Notch/Safe Area Inset Problem Often Encountered in New Projects

Wrote a utility class to record the edge insets:

``` objc

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

#define YZAreaInsets [YZUtilTool yz_safeAreaInsets]


@interface YZUtilTool : NSObject

+ (UIEdgeInsets)yz_safeAreaInsets;

@end


@implementation YZUtilTool

+ (UIEdgeInsets)yz_safeAreaInsets {
    UIWindow *window = [UIApplication sharedApplication].windows.firstObject;
    if (![window isKeyWindow]) {
        UIWindow *keyWindow = [UIApplication sharedApplication].keyWindow;
        if (CGRectEqualToRect(keyWindow.bounds, [UIScreen mainScreen].bounds)) {
            window = keyWindow;
        }
    }
    if (@available(iOS 11.0, *)) {
        UIEdgeInsets insets = [window safeAreaInsets];
        return insets;
    }
    return UIEdgeInsetsZero;
}


@end

```

This is the process code.
