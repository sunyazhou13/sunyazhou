# The Problem

The integer array `nums` is sorted in ascending order, with all values being distinct.

Before being passed to the function, `nums` was rotated at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the array becomes `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (0-indexed). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` rotated at index `3` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the rotated array `nums` and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it exists in `nums`, otherwise return `-1`.

You must design an algorithm with `O(log n)` time complexity to solve this problem.

#### Example 1

``` sh 
输入：nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
输出：4

```

#### Example 2

``` sh 
输入：nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
输出：-1
```

#### Example 3

``` sh 
输入：nums = [1], target = 0
输出：-1
```

## Answer

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    int search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int n = (int)nums.size();
        if (!n) { return -1; }
        if (n == 1) {
            return nums[0] == target? 0 : -1;
        }
        int left = 0, right = n -1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (right + left) /2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (nums[0] <= nums[mid]) {
                if (nums[0] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid -1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[n-1]) {
                    left = mid +1;
                } else {
                    right = mid -1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
