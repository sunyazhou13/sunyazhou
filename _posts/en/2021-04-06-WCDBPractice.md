### What have I been up to lately?

I've been wrestling with WCDB lately. My company builds an IM product, and we maintain a very old codebase. To lay a solid foundation and solve upper-layer business problems, we decided to migrate from the original FMDB to WCDB in batches.

### The problem I ran into

While using WCDB, I hit a really elementary bug: the condition placed after the `where` clause.

First, let's look at the code and a reproduction of the business problem scenario:

``` objc
- (BOOL)updateMsgHeight:(SYMessage *)msg toTable:(NSString *)tableName {
    if (tableName.length == 0) { return NO; }
    if (msg.messageId.length == 0) { return NO; }
    BOOL result = [[self dataBase] updateRowsInTable:[self tablenameByID:tableName]
                                          onProperty:SYMessage.chatMsgHeight
                                           withValue:msg.chatMsgHeight
                                               where:{SYMessage.messageId == msg.messageId && 
                                               		  SYMessage.type = msg.type}];
    return result;
}
```

The `cell` heights look wrong.

After inspecting the database file with the [FLEX tool](https://github.com/FLEXTool/FLEX), I found that the `chatMsgHeight` values in the database were all identical.

After carefully checking all the SQL statements, I found one call like this in the console:

``` sh
UPDATE msg_10003600 SET chatMsgHeight=? WHERE 1.000000 

```

Its correct form should be:

``` sh
SQL: UPDATE msg_10003600 SET chatMsgHeight=? WHERE ((messageId='936542df77de41778139a42b4f4be296') AND (type=2))
```

No need to think twice — the condition after `where` in the `SQL` statement was always `true`, which produced this bug so elementary it couldn't get any more elementary.

Here's the corrected code:

``` objc
- (BOOL)updateMsgHeight:(SYMessage *)msg toTable:(NSString *)tableName {
    if (tableName.length == 0) { return NO; }
    if (msg.messageId.length == 0) { return NO; }
    BOOL result = [[self dataBase] updateRowsInTable:[self tablenameByID:tableName]
                                          onProperty:SYMessage.chatMsgHeight
                                           withValue:msg.chatMsgHeight
                                               where:{SYMessage.messageId == msg.messageId && 
                                               		  SYMessage.type == msg.type}];
    return result;
}
```
The problem was that it should be `SYMessage.type == msg.type`, not `SYMessage.type = msg.type`.

> `==` means strictly equal
> `=` means assignment
> WCDB doesn't flag an error because this isn't an error — it's a normal code assignment, and the C++ compiler won't complain either.

So watch out for this `pitfall`, folks. It was clearly caused by me leaving out an equals sign — after all, WCDB isn't a compiler and can't correct for us the `lexical analysis`, `syntax analysis`, `semantic analysis`, or `grammar analysis` errors covered in compiler theory.

### My honest experience after using WCDB

Fast! Convenient! Clean code!

I migrated all the core modules involved in the chat feature — the conversation list, the message list, all of it — to WCDB.

Another pitfall worth noting for everyone: when migrating from FMDB to WCDB, always remember — `go all the way or don't go at all`: replace everything in one pass, otherwise queue deadlocks and contention can easily occur. Don't believe me? Try it and see.


### Documentation roundup

[WCDB — Tencent's open-source mobile database framework](https://www.bookstack.cn/read/tencent-wcdb/66f893c12ef91f78.md) — this link opens fast in China

[FLEX debugging tool](https://github.com/FLEXTool/FLEX) — lets you inspect in real time all kinds of UIViews, network, objects, memory, sandbox files, and more inside the app.


# Summary

Next I plan to read WCDB's source implementation and share some frequently used techniques. WCDB made me relearn database fundamentals all over again.
