I've been learning some Swift syntax recently, and I've taken notes on some of the more interesting bits.

## The Problem

### How do you read a text file, determine the usage frequency of all words, sort them from high to low, and print out a ranked list of all words and their frequencies?

> This question comes from a famous event in the history of computer science. It was a challenge posed by Jon Bentley, author of the "Programming Pearls" column in Communications of the ACM magazine, to computer science pioneer Donald Knuth.

Problem Abstraction

* A text string
* Split it into an array of individual word strings
* Traverse the array, filtering out words that don't need to be counted
* Count word usage frequency and print it

#### Solution Using the Traditional Programming Paradigm

``` swift 
import UIKit

let words = "Blogging is about going through a memory stack of searching and storing knowledge, references, keyword indexing, and so on. Because my brain started like a memory stack, from empty stack to stack overflow, later use heap to store knowledge, found that memory is also OOM. Then I used reference tags to store iOS developing-related articles, tutorials, tricks, tricks, practice code, etc., which made my browser tabs look like they were poisoned. Later, I only remembered a few keywords to Google related articles. Sometimes some people post articles and delete them, so I can't find them. In addition, I have accumulated some skills and shared some skills. So I decided to blog about it. My skills are way, way out of line with yours truly. So I should write more and record the bit by bit of my growth process. Even though my views are filled with too many narrow theories and immature arguments, I must know that today is not yesterday. Otherwise I would have been sorry for wasting my time and ashamed for doing nothing."
let NON_WORDS = ["a", "of", "and", "!"]
func wordFrep(word: String) -> [String: Int] {
    var wordDict:[String: Int] = [:]
    let wordList = words.split(separator: " ");
    for word in wordList {
        let lowercaseWord = word.lowercased()
        if !NON_WORDS.contains(lowercaseWord) {
            if let count = wordDict[lowercaseWord] {
                wordDict[lowercaseWord] = count + 1
            } else {
                wordDict[lowercaseWord] = 1
            }
        }
    }
    return wordDict
}
print(wordFrep(word: words))
```

Result:

``` sh

#### Solution Using the Functional Programming Paradigm

``` swift
import UIKit

let words = "Blogging is about going through a memory stack of searching and storing knowledge, references, keyword indexing, and so on. Because my brain started like a memory stack, from empty stack to stack overflow, later use heap to store knowledge, found that memory is also OOM.

let NON_WORDS = ["a", "of", "and", "!"]
func wordFrep2(words: String) -> [String: Int] {
    var wordDict: [String: Int] = [:]
    let wordList = words.split(separator: " ")
    wordList.map { $0.lowercased()}
            .filter{ !NON_WORDS.contains($0)}
            .forEach { wordDict[$0] = (wordDict[$0] ?? 0) + 1 }
    return wordDict
}
print(wordFrep2(words: words))
```
Result:

``` sh
["storing": 1, "were": 1, "also": 1, "many": 1, "like": 2, "filled": 1, "used": 1, "process.": 1, "skills.": 1, "more": 1, "find": 1, "record": 1, "tricks,": 2, "found": 1, "oom.": 1, "later": 1, "which": 1, "yours": 1, "ashamed": 1, "tabs": 1, "though": 1, "can\'t": 1, "blog": 1, "way,": 1, "reference": 1, "out": 1, "post": 1, "write": 1, "i": 8, "store": 2, "ios": 1, "is": 3, "they": 1, "brain": 1, "growth": 1, "with": 2, "overflow,": 1, "wasting": 1, "would": 1, "time": 1, "even": 1, "to": 5, "articles,": 1, "tags": 1, "developing-related": 1, "made": 1, "doing": 1, "browser": 1, "then": 1, "people": 1, "later,": 1, "accumulated": 1, "yesterday.": 1, "know": 1, "going": 1, "the": 1, "through": 1, "addition,": 1, "my": 6, "remembered": 1, "theories": 1, "look": 1, "them.": 1, "articles.": 1, "stack": 3, "narrow": 1, "should": 1, "so": 4, "google": 1, "too": 1, "bit": 2, "heap": 1, "articles": 1, "it.": 1, "keyword": 1, "today": 1, "way": 1, "some": 3, "code,": 1, "started": 1, "keywords": 1, "shared": 1, "indexing,": 1, "use": 1, "arguments,": 1, "few": 1, "stack,": 1, "blogging": 1, "nothing.": 1, "are": 2, "views": 1, "must": 1, "references,": 1, "poisoned.": 1, "empty": 1, "decided": 1, "sorry": 1, "searching": 1, "by": 1, "knowledge,": 2, "not": 1, "for": 2, "about": 2, "them,": 1, "been": 1, "delete": 1, "line": 1, "because": 1, "from": 1, "memory": 3, "related": 1, "that": 2, "on.": 1, "truly.": 1, "etc.,": 1, "tutorials,": 1, "in": 1, "have": 2, "practice": 1, "skills": 2, "only": 1, "immature": 1, "otherwise": 1, "sometimes": 1]

```

### Extended Problem

* Find the position of the first character in a string that appears in a given character array. For example, for "Hello， World" and ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"], "e" is the first character in the string that appears in the array, at position 1, so return 1.
* Hint: the zip function

> This question is the one most frequently asked in interviews!

``` swift
let source = "Hello world"
let target: [Character] = ["a","e","i","o","u"]
zip(0..<source.count, source).forEach { (index, char) in
   if target.contains(char) {
       print(index)
   }
}
```

The result is:

``` sh
1
4
7
```

### What Is the zip Function?

In Swift, the `zip` function isn't for compressing files. Its purpose is to combine the elements of two sequences one-to-one into a new sequence.

eg:

``` swift
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let b = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
let c = zip(a, b).map { $0 }
print(c)
//输出 [(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c"), (4, "d")]
```

Or:

``` swift
let b = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
let c = zip(1..., b).map { $0 }
print(c)
//输出 [(1, "a"), (2, "b"), (3, "c"), (4, "d")]
```

# Summary

After reading this article, did you learn?

* How to calculate the frequency of words appearing in a text
* How to find the position of the first character in a string that appears in a given character array
* How to use the zip() function in Swift

Technical skills require continuous learning; weekend time shouldn't be wasted. After studying for an afternoon, I've recorded all the important content. If you don't understand it fully, I recommend carefully studying Swift once and you'll get it.
