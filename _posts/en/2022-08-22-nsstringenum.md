# Enums


In `Objective-C`, there is no dedicated type for defining string enums. The enums we commonly use are integer-based and auto-increment by +1.

``` objc
typedef NS_ENUM(NSInteger, YZAnimationType) {
    YZAnimationTypeDefault = 0,
    YZAnimationType1       = 1,
    YZAnimationType2       = 2,
    YZAnimationType3       = 3,
    YZAnimationType4       = 4,
    YZAnimationTypeCount,
};
```

C++ has dedicated enum classes, but Objective-C in iOS does not have the equivalent of C++ enum classes. Today let's learn about an enum type defined using constant string literals.

Let's create a new class called `YZEnumConst.h` and write the following code:

``` objc
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

typedef NSString * const kComponentMessage NS_STRING_ENUM;
FOUNDATION_EXPORT kComponentMessage const kComponentMessageXXXXX;
```

In `YZEnumConst.m`, write:

``` objc
kComponentMessage const kComponentMessageXXXXX = @"ComponentMessageXXXXX";

```

This way, a string enum type in Objective-C is constructed using type aliases.

> Note: The declaration must be in the `.h` file and the implementation must be in the `.m` file; otherwise, you'll get a symbol-not-found compilation error.


Here you'll notice the keywords `NS_STRING_ENUM` and `FOUNDATION_EXPORT`.

* `NS_STRING_ENUM` indicates the type is specifically for string enums
* `FOUNDATION_EXPORT` represents an externally exposed string constant declaration.

Combining the above usage rules, we can look at Apple's internal definitions—for example, the commonly used timing function constants in animation.

``` objc
typedef NSString * CAMediaTimingFunctionName NS_TYPED_ENUM;
CA_EXTERN CAMediaTimingFunctionName const kCAMediaTimingFunctionLinear
    API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.5), ios(2.0), watchos(2.0), tvos(9.0));
CA_EXTERN CAMediaTimingFunctionName const kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseIn
    API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.5), ios(2.0), watchos(2.0), tvos(9.0));
CA_EXTERN CAMediaTimingFunctionName const kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseOut
    API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.5), ios(2.0), watchos(2.0), tvos(9.0));
CA_EXTERN CAMediaTimingFunctionName const kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut
    API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.5), ios(2.0), watchos(2.0), tvos(9.0));
CA_EXTERN CAMediaTimingFunctionName const kCAMediaTimingFunctionDefault
    API_AVAILABLE(macos(10.6), ios(3.0), watchos(2.0), tvos(9.0));
```

`CA_EXTERN` is defined in `<CoreGraphics/CGBase.h>`

``` objc
#ifndef CA_EXTERN
# define CA_EXTERN extern __attribute__((visibility("default")))
#endif
```

This implementation follows Apple's timing function string enum pattern.

# Summary

Recording valuable knowledge during development allows you to complete work more quickly and improve efficiency when you need it.
