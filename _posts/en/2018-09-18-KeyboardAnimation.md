# Preface

It's been a long time since I wrote a technical article. This one records a small detail of the keyboard pop-up animation, with a flow like WeChat.


Here's the image

# Animation detail code


The core of the details mainly lies in some keys in the notification

* Animation duration
* The animation curve

...

The notification below receives the "keyboard will show" notification `UIKeyboardWillShowNotification`



``` objc
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(didReceiveKeyboardShowNotification:)
                                                 name:UIKeyboardWillShowNotification
                                               object:nil];
```

Then comes the core implementation code

``` objc
- (void)didReceiveKeyboardShowNotification:(NSNotification *)noti {
    NSDictionary *userInfo = noti.userInfo;
    NSTimeInterval animationDuration;
    UIViewAnimationCurve animationCurve;
    CGRect keyboardFrame;
    [[userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey] getValue:&animationCurve];
    [[userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey] getValue:&animationDuration];
    [[userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] getValue:&keyboardFrame];
    
    UIViewAnimationOptions animationOptions = animationCurve << 16;
    
    self.bottomConstrains.offset = -CGRectGetHeight(keyboardFrame);
    [UIView animateWithDuration:animationDuration delay:0. options:animationOptions animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsUpdateConstraints];
        [self.view layoutIfNeeded];
    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
        
    }];
}
```

> self.bottomConstrains.offset = -CGRectGetHeight(keyboardFrame); is the constraint I wrote — please refer to the demo for details


Keyboard dismissal works the same way — receive the `UIKeyboardWillHideNotification` key

``` objc
[[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self
                                             selector:@selector(didReceiveKeyboardHideNotification:)
                                                 name:UIKeyboardWillHideNotification
                                               object:nil];
```


When it dismisses, just set the constraint offset to `0`

``` objc
- (void)didReceiveKeyboardHideNotification:(NSNotification *)noti {
    NSDictionary *userInfo = noti.userInfo;
    NSTimeInterval animationDuration;
    UIViewAnimationCurve animationCurve;
    CGRect keyboardFrame;
    [[userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardAnimationCurveUserInfoKey] getValue:&animationCurve];
    [[userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardAnimationDurationUserInfoKey] getValue:&animationDuration];
    [[userInfo objectForKey:UIKeyboardFrameEndUserInfoKey] getValue:&keyboardFrame];
    
    UIViewAnimationOptions animationOptions = animationCurve << 16;
    self.bottomConstrains.offset = 0;
    [UIView animateWithDuration:animationDuration delay:0. options:animationOptions animations:^{
        [self.view setNeedsUpdateConstraints];
        [self.view layoutIfNeeded];
    } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
        
    }];
}
```

> self.bottomConstrains.offset = 0; //set the offset back to its original position



The animation is done with Masonry


Finally, don't forget to remove the notification observer


``` objc
- (void)dealloc {
    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] removeObserver:self];
}
```


# Summary


This tiny detail of the keyboard popping up is easily overlooked. I wrote this article to record the knowledge and techniques. I hope you all can offer plenty of advice.
