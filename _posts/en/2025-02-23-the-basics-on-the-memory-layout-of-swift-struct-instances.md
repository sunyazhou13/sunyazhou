## Background

![Ver Tex Buffer Layout](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/VerTexBufferLayout.avif)

While studying "Metal.by.Tutorials.4th.2023.12" in 2024, the book mentioned the memory layout of Swift struct instances, so I put these notes together.

## Size, Stride, Alignment

The basics of the memory layout of Swift struct instances
> March 12, 2018 ∙ Swift Internals ∙ By Greg Heo

When working with Swift types in memory, there are three properties to consider: size, stride, and alignment.

## Size

Let's illustrate with two structs:

``` swift
struct Year {
  let year: Int
}

struct YearWithMonth {
  let year: Int
  let month: Int
}
```

My intuition says an instance of YearWithMonth is bigger than an instance of Year — it takes up more space in memory. But we're scientists; how do we verify intuition with hard data?

## Memory Layout

We can use the `MemoryLayout` type to inspect some properties of our types in memory.

To find the size of a struct, use the size property with a generic parameter:

``` swift
let size = MemoryLayout<Year>.size
```

If you have an instance of a type, use the `size(ofValue:)` static function:

``` swift
let instance = Year(year: 1984)
let size = MemoryLayout.size(ofValue: instance)
```

In both cases, the size is reported as **8 bytes**.

Unsurprisingly, the size of our struct `YearWithMonth` is **16 bytes**.

## Back to Size

The size of a struct seems straightforward — add up the size of each property. For a struct like this:

``` swift
struct Puppy {
  let age: Int
  let isTrained: Bool
}
```

the size of the struct should match the sizes of its properties:

``` swift
MemoryLayout<Int>.size + MemoryLayout<Bool>.size
// returns 9, from 8 + 1

MemoryLayout<Puppy>.size
// returns 9
```

Looks fine! [Aside: is it really? 😈]

## Stride

Stride becomes important when you're working with multiple instances in a single buffer, like an array.

If we had a contiguous array of puppies, each 9 bytes in size, what would that look like in memory?

![stride-nopadding](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/stride-nopadding.avif)

Turns out, not like that. ❌

The `stride` determines the distance between two elements, and it's usually greater than or equal to the size.

``` swift
MemoryLayout<Puppy>.size
// returns 9

MemoryLayout<Puppy>.stride
// returns 16
```

So the actual layout looks like this:

![stride-padding](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/stride-padding.avif)

In other words, if you have a byte pointer to the first element and want to move to the second, the stride is how many bytes you need to advance the pointer.

Why would the size and stride differ? That brings us to the last magic number of memory layout.

## Alignment

Imagine a computer that fetches memory 8 bits (that is, 1 byte) at a time. Fetching byte 1 or byte 7 takes the same amount of time.

![alignment-byte](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-byte8.avif)

Then you upgrade to a 16-bit computer that accesses data in 16-bit words. You still have some old software that wants to access data byte-by-byte, but imagine the magic that could happen here: if the software asks for byte 0 and byte 1, the computer can now access word 0 in one go, then split the 16-bit result.

![alignment-byte](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-byte16.avif)

In this ideal world, byte-wise memory access is twice as fast! 🎉

Now imagine a misbehaving program puts a 16-bit value in like this:

![alignment-misaligned](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-misaligned16.avif)

Then you ask the computer to read a 16-bit word starting at byte position 3. The problem is, this value is misaligned. To read it, the computer has to read the word at position 1, cut it in half, read the word at position 2, cut that in half, and stitch the halves together. That means accessing one 16-bit value takes two separate 16-bit memory reads — twice as slow as it should be! 😭

On some systems, misaligned access isn't just slow — it's outright not allowed, and it will crash your program.

## Simple Swift Types

In Swift, the alignment of simple types like `Int` and `Double` is the same as their size. A 32-bit (4-byte) integer has a size of 4 bytes and needs to be aligned to 4 bytes.

``` swift
MemoryLayout<Int32>.size
// returns 4
MemoryLayout<Int32>.alignment
// returns 4
MemoryLayout<Int32>.stride
// returns 4
```

The stride is also 4, which means values in a contiguous buffer are 4 bytes apart. No padding needed.

## Compound Types

Now back to our `Puppy` struct, which has an `Int` property and a `Bool` property. Consider again the case where values sit right next to each other in a buffer:

![alignment-nopadding-bytes](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-nopadding-bytes.avif)

The position of the `Bool` values is no problem, since their alignment is 1 (`alignment=1`). But the second integer is misaligned. It's a 64-bit (8-byte) value with an alignment of 8 (`alignment=8`), and its byte position isn't a multiple of 8. ❌

Remember, the stride of this type is 16, so the buffer actually looks like this:

![alignment-padding-bytes](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-padding-bytes.avif)

We preserve the alignment requirements of all the values inside the struct: the second integer sits at byte 16, a multiple of 8.

That's why a struct's stride can be larger than its size: enough padding is added to satisfy alignment requirements.

## Computing Alignment

So, at the end of our journey, what's the alignment of the `Puppy` struct type?

``` swift
MemoryLayout<Puppy>.alignment
// returns 8
```

The alignment of a struct type is the largest alignment among all its properties. Between `Int` and `Bool`, `Int` has the larger alignment of 8, so the struct uses that.

The stride, then, is the size rounded up to the next multiple of the alignment. In our case:

- The size is 9
- 9 is not a multiple of 8
- The next multiple of 8 after 9 is 16
- So the stride is 16

## One Last Complication

Consider our original `Puppy` and compare it with `AlternatePuppy`:

``` swift
struct Puppy {
  let age: Int
  let isTrained: Bool
} // Int, Bool

struct AlternatePuppy { 
  let isTrained: Bool
  let age: Int
} // Bool, Int

```

The `AlternatePuppy` struct still has an alignment of 8 and a stride of 16, but:

``` swift
MemoryLayout<AlternatePuppy>.size
// returns 16
```

What?! We only changed the order of the properties. Why is the size different now? It should still be 9, right? A boolean followed by an integer, like this:

![alignment-internal-](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-internal-1.avif)

Maybe you can see the problem: the 8-byte integer is no longer aligned! It actually looks like this in memory:

![alignment-internal-](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/alignment-internal-2.avif)

The struct itself must be aligned, and the properties inside the struct must also stay aligned. Padding bytes get inserted between elements, and the overall size of the struct grows accordingly.

In this case the stride is still 16, so the real change from `Puppy` to `AlternatePuppy` is the position of the padding bytes. What about these structs?

``` swift
struct CertifiedPuppy1 {
  let age: Int
  let isTrained: Bool
  let isCertified: Bool
} // Int, Bool, Bool

struct CertifiedPuppy2 {
  let isTrained: Bool
  let age: Int
  let isCertified: Bool
} // Bool, Int, Bool
```

What are the size, stride, and alignment of these two structs? 🤔 (Hint.)

## Closing Brace

Say you have an `UnsafeRawPointer` (the equivalent of `void *` in C). You know the type it points to. What role do size, stride, and alignment play here?

- **Size**: the number of bytes to read from the pointer to get all the data.
- **Stride**: the number of bytes to move forward to get to the next item in the buffer.
- **Alignment**: the "divisible by" number that each instance must sit at. If you're allocating memory to copy data into, you need to specify the correct alignment (for example: `allocate(byteCount: 100, alignment: 4)`).

![size-stride-alignment-summary](/assets/images/20250223SwiftStructMemoryLayout/size-stride-alignment-summary.avif)

For most of us, most of the time, we work with high-level collections like arrays and sets and don't need to think about the memory layout underneath.

In other cases, you might need to use low-level APIs on the platform, or interoperate with C code. If you have an array of Swift structs and need C code to read it (or vice versa), then you need to worry about allocating buffers with the correct alignment, ensuring the padding bytes inside the structs line up, and making sure you have the right stride values so the data is interpreted correctly.

As we've seen, even computing the size isn't as simple as it looks — there's an interplay between the sizes and alignments of each property that determines the overall size of the struct. So understanding all three means you're on your way to becoming a master of memory management.

# Summary

When getting started with Metal, you need to manipulate memory with Swift types. My understanding of type memory layout and alignment in Swift wasn't very clear, so I put this article together — hope it helps you too.
