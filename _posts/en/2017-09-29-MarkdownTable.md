# Preface

![](/assets/images/20170929MarkdownTable/table.avif)

I used to always fail to insert tables in markdown. This post shares how to insert tables in markdown.

demo:

* Plain style

```
| 一个普通标题 | 一个普通标题 | 一个普通标题 |
| ------| ------ | ------ |
| 短文本 | 中等文本 | 稍微长一点的文本 |
| 稍微长一点的文本 | 短文本 | 中等文本 |

```

The rendered result looks like this

| A plain header | A plain header | A plain header |
| ------| ------ | ------ |
| Short text | Medium text | Slightly longer text |
| Slightly longer text | Short text | Medium text |


Alignment

``` 
| 左对齐标题 | 右对齐标题 | 居中对齐标题 |
| :------| ------: | :------: |
| 短文本 | 中等文本 | 稍微长一点的文本 |
| 稍微长一点的文本 | 短文本 | 中等文本 |

```

The result looks like this

| Left-aligned header | Right-aligned header | Centered header |
| :------| ------: | :------: |
| Short text | Medium text | Slightly longer text |
| Slightly longer text | Short text | Medium text |


Syntax notes:

* Extra spaces between `|`, `-`, `:`, are ignored and do not affect the layout.
* By default the header row is **centered**, and the content is left-aligned.
* `-:` means the content and the header are right-aligned.
* `:-` means the content and the header are left-aligned.
* `:-:` means the content and the header are centered.
* Extra spaces between **content** and `|` are ignored.
* The first `|` and the last `|` on each line can be omitted.
* There must be at least one `-`.



I always forget how to write a markdown table.

If you need to add a column, you can copy and paste the `|` from the previous row and the `|:-----:|` from the row below.

I use the open-source, free [MacDown](https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown/releases). Feel free to download it — I use it for publishing articles.
