# Preface

Recently I've been studying OpenGL ES and GPU-related topics, and I found this article to be a valuable introductory reference.

### Understanding UIView drawing — how does a UIView get displayed on the screen?

Let's start with the `Runloop`. iOS's `MainRunloop` is a 60fps callback, meaning the screen is drawn once every 16.7ms. Within this time frame, the following work must be completed:

* Creating the `view`'s buffer
* Drawing the `view`'s content (if `drawRect` is overridden)

These are the `CPU`'s tasks.

The buffer is then handed over to the `GPU` for rendering, a process that includes:

* Compositing multiple `view`s
* Rendering textures (`Texture`), etc.

The result finally appears on the screen. Therefore, if these operations can't be completed within 16.7ms — for example, the `CPU` does too much work, or the `view` hierarchy is too deep, or the images are too large, putting too much pressure on the `GPU` — the UI will stutter, i.e. **dropped frames**.

Apple's officially recommended optimal frame rate is __60fps__ (60Hz), meaning not a single frame is dropped. Of course, that's the ideal experience.

### How should we understand this `60fps`?

Generally speaking, if the frame rate reaches `60+fps` (fps >= 60; in fact, once the frame rate exceeds 50, the human eye can barely perceive any stuttering), so if you can keep your iOS app __stably__ at `60fps`, that's already quite good. Note the word "stable" — stable at 60fps, not jumping around like `10fps`, `40fps`, `20fps`. An unstable frame rate will feel laggy. `60fps` is really hard to achieve, especially on 32-bit devices like the iPhone 4/4s. But now Apple has fully abandoned 32-bit, and supporting 64-bit as the minimum makes things much better.

> fps represents the refresh rate, measured in Hertz (Hz). Considering energy consumption, visual experience, and other factors in electronic engineering, 60Hz is a fairly ideal refresh rate, which is why 60Hz often appears on home appliances.
> In video, a frame rate of FPS >= 25 is needed for the human eye not to perceive stuttering, because in video, the blurry I/P/B frames provide some of the neighboring frames' pixel information to facilitate the GPU's off-screen rendering, and the GPU's index can save a lot of performance.

Overall, the process from UIView drawing to rendering involves the following steps:

* Every `UIView` has a `layer`
* Every `layer` has a `content`, and this `content` points to a buffer called the __`backing store`__.

`UIView` drawing and rendering are two separate processes:

* When a `UIView` is drawn, the `CPU` executes `drawRect`, writing data into the __`backing store`__ through the `context`
* When the __`backing store`__ is done, it's handed over to the `GPU` for rendering via the render server, which displays the bitmap data from the backing store on the screen.

The process from `CPU` to `GPU` described above can be illustrated by the diagram below:

Let's discuss this process in detail.

* CPU bound:

Suppose we create a UILabel:

``` objc
UILabel* label = [[UILabel alloc]initWithFrame:CGRectMake(10, 50, 300, 14)];
label.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor];
label.font = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:14.0f];
label.text = @"test";
[self.view addSubview:label];
```

Nothing happens at this point. Since UILabel overrides the `drawRect` method, this `view` gets marked as "dirty":

Something like this:

![](/assets/images/20171016UIViewRendering/DrawRect.avif)



Then a new `Runloop` arrives. As mentioned above, the interface needs to be rendered in this `Runloop`. For `UIKit` rendering, Apple uses its `Core Animation`.
The approach is to call this at the start of the Runloop:

``` objc
[CATransaction begin]
```

And call this at the end of the `Runloop`:

``` objc

[CATransaction commit]

```

Between `begin` and `commit`, the `view` is added to the `view hierarchy`, and again no drawing happens.
After `[CATransaction commit]` executes, the `CPU` starts drawing the `view`:

![CPU drawing](/assets/images/20171016UIViewRendering/CATransactionCommit.avif)


First, the `CPU` allocates a block of memory for the `layer` to draw the `bitmap`, called the __`backing store`__  
It creates a pointer to this `bitmap` buffer, called `CGContextRef`  
It draws the `bitmap` via the `Core Graphic` api, also known as `Quartz2D`  
It points the `layer`'s `content` at the generated `bitmap`  
It clears the `dirty flag`  
That basically completes the `CPU`'s drawing.  
The whole process can be fully observed with the `time profiler`:  

``` sh

Running Time Self Symbol Name
2.0ms 1.2% 0.0 +[CATransaction flush]
2.0ms 1.2% 0.0 CA::Transaction::commit()
2.0ms 1.2% 0.0 CA::Context::commit_transaction(CA::Transaction*)
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 CA::Layer::layout_and_display_if_needed(CA::Transaction*)
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 CA::Layer::display_if_needed(CA::Transaction*)
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 -[CALayer display]
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 CA::Layer::display()
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 -[CALayer _display]
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 CA::Layer::display_()
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 CABackingStoreUpdate_
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 backing_callback(CGContext*, void*)
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 -[CALayer drawInContext:]
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 -[UIView(CALayerDelegate) drawLayer:inContext:]
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 -[UILabel drawRect:]
1.0ms 0.6% 0.0 -[UILabel drawTextInRect:]  
```


If the `label`'s `text` is modified at some point:  


``` objc
label.text = @"hello world";
```


Since the content changed, the size of the `layer` `content`'s `bitmap` must change too. So when the new `Runloop` arrives, the `CPU` has to create a new `backing store` for the `layer` and redraw the `bitmap`.  
The most time-consuming part for the `CPU` is usually `Core Graphic` drawing. Optimizing `Core Graphic` performance is another topic that involves many other things, so we won't discuss it here.

GPU bound:


`CPU` completes its task: turning the `view` into a `bitmap`. Then it's the `GPU`'s turn — the `GPU` works with `Texture`s.      
Basically, we control the `GPU` through `OpenGL`, but there needs to be a bridge from `bitmap` to `Texture`, and `Core Animation` happens to play that role:  
`Core Animation` wraps the `OpenGL` `api`. When the `layer` we want to render already has `bitmap` content — which is generally a `CGImageRef` — `CoreAnimation` creates an `OpenGL` `Texture` and binds the `CGImageRef (bitmap)` to that `Texture`, identified by a `TextureID`.  
Once this correspondence is established, the remaining task is how the `GPU` renders the `Texture` to the screen.  
The `GPU`'s general working model is as follows:

![](/assets/images/20171016UIViewRendering/GPUWorkflow.avif)

The whole process boils down to one thing:

The `CPU` puts the prepared `bitmap` in `RAM`, and the `GPU` moves that memory to `VRAM` for processing.  
The `GPU`'s limit for this process is roughly completing one frame in 16.7ms, so the 60fps mentioned at the start is essentially the maximum frequency the `GPU` can handle.  
Therefore, the `GPU` faces two challenges:

*  Moving data from `RAM` to `VRAM`
*  Rendering the `Texture` to the screen    

The bottleneck between the two is basically the second one. Rendering `Texture`s basically involves the following issues:

* Compositing:

`Compositing` is the process of combining multiple textures into one. In terms of `UIKit`, it means handling the case of multiple `view`s being combined, e.g.:  

``` objc
[self.view addsubview : subview]。

```

If `view`s don't overlap, the `GPU` only needs to do ordinary rendering.  
If multiple `view`s overlap, the `GPU` needs to do `blending`.  

Suppose two `view`s have the same size and one is stacked on top of the other, the calculation formula is as follows:

`R` = `S`+`D`*(`1`-`Sa`)  

> `R`: the final pixel value  
> `S`: the Top Texture  
> `D`: the lower Texture  

Here `S` and `D` have already `pre-multiplied` their respective `alpha` values.  
`Sa` represents the `Texture`'s `alpha` value.  

If the `Top Texture`'s (the upper `view`'s) `alpha` value is `1`, i.e. opaque, it will cover the lower `Texture`.  
That is, `R` = `S`. Which makes sense.  

If the `Top Texture`'s (the upper `view`'s) `alpha` value is `0.5`,  
`S` is `(1,0,0)`, which becomes `(0.5,0,0)` after multiplying by `alpha`.  
`D` is `(0，0，1)`.  
The resulting `R` is `(0.5，0，0.5)`.  

Basically, this calculation needs to be done for each pixel.  

Therefore, a complex `view` hierarchy, or `view`s that are all semi-transparent (`alpha` not equal to `1`), will bring extra computation work to the `GPU`.


* Size

This problem mainly comes from `image`s. Suppose there's a `400x400` image in memory, and we want to put it into a `100x100` `imageview`. If we throw it in directly without any processing, there's a big problem: it means the `GPU` has to scale the large image down to fit a small area, which requires `sampling` the pixels. This kind of `sampling` is very expensive, and it also needs to take `pixel alignment` into account. The computation load will skyrocket.  

* Offscreen Rendering And Mask

If we do this to a `layer`:  

``` objc 
label.layer.cornerRadius = 5.0f;
label.layer.masksToBounds = YES;

```

it will cause `offscreen rendering`. The biggest problem it brings is that when rendering such a `layer`, extra memory needs to be allocated, the `radius` and `mask` are drawn, and then the drawn `bitmap` is assigned back to the `layer`.  
Therefore, for performance reasons, `Quartz` provides an optimized `api`:

``` objc
label.layer.cornerRadius = 5.0f;
label.layer.masksToBounds = YES;
label.layer.shouldRasterize = YES;
label.layer.rasterizationScale = label.layer.contentsScale;

```

Simply put, this is a `cache` mechanism.  
Similarly, `GPU` performance can be measured with `instrument`:

Red indicates the `GPU` needs to do extra work to render the `View`; green indicates the `GPU` can process the `bitmap` without extra work.

The End
