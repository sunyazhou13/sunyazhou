# Background

In my [previous post](/2026/08/jekyllpostscaffoldmultilang) I added Hexo-style scaffolds and multi-language creation to this blog. To pin down exactly what `bundle exec jekyll post` can and cannot do, I read the entire source of the locally installed jekyll-compose 0.12.0 — and discovered it does far more than I assumed. Most people (my former self included) only ever use `jekyll post`, while the gem actually ships a complete draft workflow.

So here is a complete guide based on reading the actual source, not second-hand documentation.

# Command overview

jekyll-compose provides **7 subcommands** covering the full draft → publish lifecycle:

| Command | Syntax | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `post` | `jekyll post "Title"` | Creates a post in `_posts/` with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix |
| `draft` | `jekyll draft "Title"` | Creates a draft in `_drafts/`, **no date prefix** |
| `publish` | `jekyll publish _drafts/xxx.md` | Promotes a draft: moves it to `_posts/`, prepends the date, fills in the `date` field |
| `unpublish` | `jekyll unpublish _posts/2026-08-22-xxx.md` | The reverse: moves the post back to `_drafts/`, strips the date prefix, **removes the `date` field** |
| `rename` | `jekyll rename _posts/old-file.md "New Title"` | Renames three things at once: filename, the `title` in front matter, and optionally the date |
| `compose` | `jekyll compose "Title"` | Unified entry point: `--post` / `--draft` / `-c COLLECTION` decides where it goes, default is post |
| `page` | `jekyll page about` | Creates a static page; supports `path/name` for subdirectories |

The `draft → publish → unpublish` trio is its core design: **write a draft first, promote it when it's ready** — Hexo's `hexo publish` borrowed this idea. With drafts, you preview locally via `jekyll serve --drafts` and only publish once satisfied, avoiding the "half-finished post goes live" embarrassment.

# Shared options

All commands share a set of options:

| Option | Description | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-d, --date DATE` | Set the post date — handy for backfilling old posts | post / draft / publish / rename |
| `-l, --layout LAYOUT` | Set the layout, default `post` | all |
| `-x, --extension EXT` | File extension, default `markdown`, can be `md` | all |
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite if the file already exists | all |
| `--timestamp-format FORMAT` | Custom format for the `date` field | post / publish |
| `--config FILE` | Create using a specific config file | all |
| `--now` | rename only: set the date to now | rename |
| `-c, --collection NAME` | Create in a custom collection, e.g. `-c wiki` → `_wiki/` | compose |

## Common scenarios

Backfill a post with an old date:

``` sh
bundle exec jekyll post "OldPost" -d 2026-08-01
```

Publish last year's draft with the date it was meant to have:

``` sh
bundle exec jekyll publish _drafts/old-draft.md -d 2025-12-01
```

Rename a finished post — filename and front matter together:

``` sh
bundle exec jekyll rename _posts/2026-08-22-old-title.md "New Title"
```

# _config.yml configuration

jekyll-compose has exactly two configuration keys, both under the `jekyll_compose` namespace:

## default_front_matter: inject front matter per collection

``` yaml
jekyll_compose:
  default_front_matter:
    posts:          # used by the post command
      categories: [iOS]
      tags: []
      typora-root-url: ..
      math: true
    drafts:         # used by the draft command
      layout: draft
    wiki:           # used by compose -c wiki; the key is the collection name
      foo: bar
```

**Big pitfall here**: the key is the **collection name**, so it's the plural `posts`, not `post`. The source hardcodes `front_matter_defaults_for("posts")` — writing `post` produces no error and silently does nothing. You'd only find out by reading the source.

## auto_open: open the editor after creation

``` yaml
jekyll_compose:
  auto_open: true
```

This needs an environment variable, with priority `JEKYLL_EDITOR` > `VISUAL` > `EDITOR`. For example, to open in Typora:

``` sh
# ~/.zshrc
export JEKYLL_EDITOR="open -a Typora"
```

With that set, `jekyll post` pops the editor open right after creating the file — the same experience as `hexo new`.

# Source-level behavior details

All of the following were confirmed by reading the `lib/` directory, and each one can bite you:

## Slugification

The filename comes from `Jekyll::Utils.slugify`: non-ASCII characters are dropped entirely, spaces become hyphens, everything is lowercased. So a **Chinese title produces a filename with nothing but the date prefix**. The workaround: pass an English title, then edit the `title` field in front matter to Chinese afterwards.

## date is UTC

`Time.now` is formatted with `+0000`, so a post written at 2 PM local time gets `06:00 +0000` in front matter. If that bothers you, change it to `+0800` manually before publishing.

## Front matter merge order

Generation order is `{layout, title}` ← `default_front_matter` config ← `date`. Any field can come in from the config, and `date` is always written last so it never gets overridden.

## Existing files raise an error

If the file already exists, the command aborts with an exception — no overwrite prompt, unless you pass `-f` explicitly.

## Paths are hardcoded

`_posts/` and `_drafts/` are hardcoded in the source with no configuration to change them. That's why multi-language blogs (like this site's `_posts/en/` structure) can't use it directly — you need a wrapper script that moves the file after creation, which is exactly what my previous post covers.

# Project status

0.12.0 was released in 2019 and remains the latest version. The official repository [jekyll/jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose) is in maintenance mode — bug fixes only, no new features. Don't expect it to ever support body templates or language subdirectories natively; solve those in your blog's own `tools/` directory instead.

One more limitation for multi-language sites: `rename` and `publish` only move files between `_posts/` and `_drafts/` — they don't know about `_posts/en/`. To rename a bilingual post, honestly just `mv` both files yourself.

# Summary

- jekyll-compose has 7 commands; the `draft/publish/unpublish` workflow is its most underrated feature
- Two config keys: `default_front_matter` (remember the plural collection-name key) and `auto_open` (with the `JEKYLL_EDITOR` environment variable)
- Source-level limits: hardcoded paths, no body templates, slug drops non-ASCII, date in UTC
- The project has been dormant since 2019 — deep customization has to happen in your own scripts

It's a small tool, but reading its source pins down the exact capability boundary of every command, which makes using it a lot more confident. Combined with the scaffold setup from the previous post, my publishing workflow is finally fully sorted.
