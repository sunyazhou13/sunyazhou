## SwiftUI Course

I've kept up learning SwiftUI and have now reached Chapter 3, so I'm writing down the important parts.

### Main Contents

* Presenting a child VC
* Managing icons with an enum
* Markdown can be used in comments
* How to write extensions

### Presenting a child VC

In SwiftUI, you can't really call it presenting a VC; instead, you present a view of type some View.

``` swift
var foodDetailView: some View {
        VStack {
            if (shouldShowInfo) {
                Grid(horizontalSpacing: 12, verticalSpacing: 12) {
                    GridRow {
                        Text("蛋白质")
                        Text("脂肪")
                        Text("碳水")
                    }.frame(minWidth: 40)
                    
                    Divider()
                        .gridCellUnsizedAxes(.horizontal)
                        .padding(.horizontal, -10)
                    
                    GridRow {
                        Text(selectedFood!.$protein)
                        Text(selectedFood!.$carb)
                        Text(selectedFood!.$fat)
                    }
                }
                .font(.title3)
                .padding(.horizontal)
                .padding()
                .roudedRectBackground()
                .transition(.moveUpWithOpacity)
            }
        }
        .maxWidth()
        .clipped()
    }
```

Really, you just create a View and you're done — no complicated operations needed. There is no push and pop like in UIKit, nor present and dismiss. Here it's basically views driven by state listening: whether to show or not has changed the way we used to work.

### Managing icons with an enum

When you end up using a lot of icons, you need variables that fetch images from a single unified data source. Since Swift enums can be declared with various raw types — usually strings — string-based enum cases naturally come into play.

``` swift
import SwiftUI

enum SFSymbol: String {
    case pencil
    case plus = "plus.circle.fill"
    case chevronUp = "chevron.up"
    case chevronDown = "chevron.down"
    case xmark = "xmark.circle.fill"
    case forkAndKnife = "fork.knife"
    case info = "info.circle.fill"
}

extension SFSymbol : View {
    var body: Image {
        Image(systemName: rawValue)
    }
    
    func resizable() -> Image {
        self.body.resizable()
    }
}

extension Label where Title == Text, Icon == Image {
    init(_ text: String, systemImage: SFSymbol) {
        self.init(text, systemImage: systemImage.rawValue)
    }
}
```

Usage:

``` swift
var addButton : some View {
        Button {
            sheet = .newFood { food.append($0) }
        } label: {
            SFSymbol.plus  //直接使用
                .font(.system(size: 50))
                .padding()
                .symbolRenderingMode(.palette)
                .foregroundStyle(.white, Color.accentColor.gradient)
        }
    }
```

####  Markdown Works in Comments

First, look at two functions:

``` swift
/// - Tag:push
func push(to alignment: TextAlignment) -> some View {
    switch alignment {
    case .leading:
        return frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment:  .leading)
    case .center:
        return frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment:  .center)
    case .trailing:
        return frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment:  .trailing)
    }
}
    
/// Use maximum width Shortcut:[push(to:.center)](x-source-tag://push)
func maxWidth() -> some View {
    push(to: .center)
}
```

> Note: /// Use maximum width Shortcut:\[push(to:.center)\](x-source-tag://push)

Have you noticed? Comments support Markdown out of the box.

![note](/assets/images/20230805LearnSwiftUIChapter3/note1.avif)

The blue jump-intercepted function declaration is `/// - Tag:push`. The `Tag` must be written with exact casing and no spaces; it uses the `x-source-tag` scheme to jump to `push`.

### How to Write extensions

After you write a lot of extensions in a Swift project, the number of classes keeps growing and gets harder and harder to manage. To solve the manageability and readability problems:

By convention, **when creating a Swift extension, name the file by appending a + suffix**.

As shown below:

# Summary

Chapter 3 is a particularly long haul and takes patience. It also covered a form in the middle, which I didn't write about here, because there's a lot of material and it's complicated — you're better off watching the videos carefully; that's more convincing than my summary here.
