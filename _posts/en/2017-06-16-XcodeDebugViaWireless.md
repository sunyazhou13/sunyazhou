### Effect
 
Today my friend (Wang Kecheng) discovered that Xcode has a very convenient feature — you can debug and run on a real device wirelessly.

Take a look at this image.

### Configuration

Step 1: Select the device option

Step 2: Check the "via network" box

The remaining work is just unplugging that white data cable that we absolutely hate but have to use, that costs a fortune and always breaks at the connector.



*Note: the first run is a bit slow; you can plug in the cable and run it once first*
*Running environment: Xcode9 beta*
*Device OS: iOS11 beta*
*Macbook + iPhone are best on the same LAN*

I guess this will be much more usable once Apple ships the official release.

Okay, now we can have fun with it.
