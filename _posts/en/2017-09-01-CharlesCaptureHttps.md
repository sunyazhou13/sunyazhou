How to use `charles` to intercept `https` requests on iOS devices


## 1. Install Charles

Just [download it from the official website](https://www.charlesproxy.com/download/). As for cracking, Google it yourself. I'm using Charles version 4.1.3, which should be the latest at the moment.


## 2. HTTP Capture Configuration

####  (1) Check your computer's IP

#### (2) Configure HTTP proxy on your phone

Connect your phone to your computer, tap "Settings -> Wi-Fi -> connected WiFi", and set the HTTP proxy:
Server: your computer's IP address, e.g. 192.168.1.108
Port: 8888

Note: *Here I'm using my own computer's IP as an example. The red area — remember to replace it with your own computer's IP*


After setting the proxy, open Charles on your computer. When your phone makes a request, the following popup will appear:

Click **Allow** and you're done

### 3. HTTPS Capture

From the top-left menu, select `SSL Proxying Settings`

Then check `Enable SSL Proxying`

Next, click `Add`

Then in

`Host`: Enter `*` to match all. If you want to intercept, for example, *.baidu.com, then enter that

`Port`: 443 (default port). Click OK when done

Next, click `Help` -> `SSL Proxying` -> Install Root Certificate

After installing to Keychain, click on Charles's root certificate and select `Use Trust`

The next step is to install the root certificate on your phone

Now, on the phone with the proxy IP configured (on the iPhone), open the URL directly in Safari: [chls.pro/ssl](chls.pro/ssl)

Your phone will soon show this prompt — click **Allow**

Then install the certificate

After installation, the last step is **very important**

__You must go to General -> About This Phone -> Certificate Trust Settings__ to trust the certificate

If you don't trust it, you'll see the following issue when capturing:

> Note: *This seems to be required only for iOS 10.3 and above*

Finally, here's a screenshot of a successful capture (Alipay's API)
