# Preface

> These past few days the internet has been heavily regulated due to the ongoing national congress, which made my VPN proxy unreliable. Just then, [OneV's Den published a post about the classification of Swift Errors](https://onevcat.com/2017/10/swift-error-category/)  

Every time I read OneV's Den's articles, it's like Zhuge Liang chatting with Zhou Yu — a delight. Not that I'd compare myself to either of them.

While carefully reading OneV's Den's blog, I discovered that `markdown` supports many `html` tag tricks.


For example:

![In OneV's Den's article](/assets/images/20171025MarkdownSkill/MarkdownSkill.avif)


At first glance I was amazed — so many fun things can be embedded in markdown. So I asked OneV's Den about this.

[Just a simple summary tag...](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_summary.asp)

So I tested it with some code


``` html
<details>
  <summary>点击时的区域标题</summary>
  <p> - 测试 测试测试</p>
  <p> 测试二 测试三 。。。。。 .</p>
</details>
```


Now let's play around with it.


<details>
  <summary>This is Mr. Sun's blog. Click to see more.</summary>
  <p> 666666 — Yesterday was Programmers' Day. Were you tormented by PMs? QA filed a bunch of bugs you didn't want to fix.</p>
  <p> By the way, I passed my driver's license test yesterday — it took 2 months. Pretty fast, right......</p>
</details>


You can also embed images.

<details>
  <summary>Calligraphy</summary>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/aboutme/about_read_books.avif" alt=""> </p>
  <p> </p>
</details>


``` html
<details>
  <summary>书法</summary>
  <p><img src="/assets/images/aboutme/about_read_books.avif" alt=""> </p>
  <p> </p>
</details>
```

OK, those are the few lines of code we used above. Simple — just paste them into the markdown editor and the effect appears immediately.

Thanks to [OneV's Den for the guidance](https://onevcat.com/)

How to change font color in markdown, like the code below:


<font color=#0099ff size=12 face="黑体">Colored text in a custom font</font> 

``` html
<font color=#0099ff size=12 face="黑体">黑体带颜色</font>  
```
