While teaching SwiftUI, I found a very common pattern that brings a subtle layout bug.

## Common Pattern

```swift
HStack(spacing: 12) {
    Text(self.text)
    Spacer()
    Image(systemName: "tortoise.fill")
}
```

This is a natural layout idea — using `Spacer()` to separate the text on the left from the icon on the right. But when the text is long, the gap between the text and the icon becomes **much larger than the expected 12pt**.

## Problem Analysis

Replace the views with colors to see the problem clearly:

```swift
HStack(spacing: 12) {
    Color.blue
    Spacer()
    Color.red
}
```

Although `Spacer` itself takes up no width, the Stack still adds a **12pt spacing on each side of it**, making the actual gap 24pt — doubled.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Remove spacing and use padding

Remove the `spacing` parameter from the HStack and manually add padding to the child views.

### Option 2: Replace Spacer with `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` (recommended)

```swift
HStack(spacing: 12) {
    Text(self.text)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
    Image(systemName: "tortoise.fill")
}
```

## Why Recommended

The `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity)` approach is recommended for the following reasons:

- **Cleaner code**: no extra `Spacer()` view needed
- **More flexible alignment**: the `alignment` parameter sets how the stretched view aligns its content (`.leading`, `.center`, `.trailing`, etc.)
- **Safer with optional views**: no unexpected spacing accumulation when the Stack contains optional views

---

## Summary

> In a SwiftUI Stack with `spacing`, `Spacer()` adds an extra spacing on each side, doubling the gap.  
> Use `.frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)` instead of `Spacer()`.
