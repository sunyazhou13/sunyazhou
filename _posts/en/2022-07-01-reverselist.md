# The Problem

Given the head node `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the linked list and return the reversed list.  
![](/assets/images/20220701ReverseList/1.avif)

``` sh
输入：head = [1,2,3,4,5]
输出：[5,4,3,2,1]
```

## Answer

``` c++
//Definition for singly-linked list.
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};
 
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode *prev = nullptr;
        ListNode *curr = head;
        while (curr){
            ListNode *next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```
