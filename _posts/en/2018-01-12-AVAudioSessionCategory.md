# Preface


The first post of the 2018 new year. Let me sort out the `Category` of `AVAudioSession` to solve the various audio development problems where playback gets interrupted or there is no sound on first launch.


## Opening

Because of the special nature of the `iOS` system, all `Apps` share a single `AVAudioSession`, so this session is a singleton object. (`macOS` supports playing multiple audio files simultaneously.)

When things like `plugging/unplugging headphones`, `incoming calls`, `invoking siri`, and so on happen, the audio session is interrupted by system events, and you'll see behaviors like the following:

* Should we record or play?
* What should happen when the system mute switch is toggled?
* Should sound come from the speaker or from the earpiece?
* What should happen after plugging/unplugging headphones?
* What should happen when a call comes in or the alarm goes off?
* What should happen when other audio Apps start?


### Default session behavior

* Playback is allowed, but recording is not.
* When the user flips the mute switch on the phone to "mute", if audio is playing, the playback will be muted.
* When the user presses the lock button or the phone auto-locks, if audio is playing, the playback will be muted and paused.
* If your App starts playing while other Apps such as QQ Music are playing, the other players will be muted and paused.

The default behavior of `AVAudioSession` is equivalent to setting the `Category` to `AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient`

Example code:

``` objc
- (void)configSession{	
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient error:&error];
    if (error) {
        NSLog(@"%@",error);
    }
}
```

### AVAudioSession

As mentioned above, this class is a singleton

``` objc
+ (AVAudioSession *)sharedInstance;
```

Obtain the singleton via the method above

Although the system activates this single `AVAudioSession` when the app launches, it's best to activate it again when you actually use it:

``` 
- (BOOL)setActive:(BOOL)active error:(NSError * _Nullable *)outError;
```
Set `active` to `YES` to activate the `Session`, or `NO` to deactivate it. The `BOOL` return value indicates success; on failure, you can check the cause via `NSError`'s `error.localizedDescription`.

> Because `AVAudioSession` affects the behavior of other `Apps`, when your `App`'s `Session` is activated, the sessions of other `Apps` are deactivated.

__What if you want to restore the activation state of other `Apps' Sessions` after deactivating your own?__

In that case you can use:

```
- (BOOL)setActive:(BOOL)active withOptions:(AVAudioSessionSetActiveOptions)options error:(NSError * _Nullable *)outError;
```

__Just pass `AVAudioSessionSetActiveOptionNotifyOthersOnDeactivation` as the `options` here.__

Of course, you can also use the `otherAudioPlaying` property to check in advance whether another app is currently playing audio.

``` objc
NSLog(@"Current Category:%@", [AVAudioSession sharedInstance].category); //返回当前 category
```

``` sh
Current Category:AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbien
```

### The Seven Categories

Below I'll introduce the seven very important `Category` types of `AVAudioSession`.

``` objc
#pragma mark -- Values for the category property --

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient;

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient;

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback;

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord;

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord;

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategoryAudioProcessing NS_DEPRECATED_IOS(3_0, 10_0) __TVOS_PROHIBITED __WATCHOS_PROHIBITED;

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(6_0);
```



`AVAudioSession` divides audio usage scenarios into seven categories. By setting the `Session` to different categories, you can control:

* Whether activating the Session interrupts audio from other Apps that don't support mixing
* Whether it responds to the phone's "mute" switch or lockscreen by muting
* Whether the current state supports recording
* Whether the current state supports playback
* Every app starts with the default state described above, i.e., other Apps are interrupted and playback responds to the "mute" switch. The table below breaks down what each category supports:

| Category | Muted when "mute" is pressed or the screen is locked | Interrupts Apps that don't support mixing | Supports recording and playback |
| :------: | :------: | :------: | :------: |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient | Yes | No | Playback only |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryAudioProcessing | N/A | Neither | N/A |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute | No | Yes | Both recording and playback |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord | No | Not by default | Both recording and playback |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback | No | Yes by default | Playback only |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord | No | Yes | Recording only |
| AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient | Yes | Yes | Playback only |


You can see that the default is in fact the `AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient` category.  
From the table we can summarize the following:  

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient`: Only for playing music, and it can play simultaneously with QQ Music. For example, if you want to keep listening to QQ Music while playing a game, set the game's background audio to this category. At the same time, the audio is muted when the user locks the screen or mutes. This category basically fits the background scenarios of all Apps._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryAudioProcessing`: Mainly for audio format processing; usually used together with AudioUnit._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute`: Imagine a DJ app: the phone is connected via HDMI to speakers playing the current track while the next track plays in the headphones — a scenario ordinary people wouldn't understand. This category supports input/output from multiple devices._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord`: What if you want to both play and record? For scenarios like VoIP or phone calls, PlayAndRecord is designed exactly for this._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback`: What if you want to keep hearing audio when the screen is locked? Use this category — for example, when the app itself is a player. Meanwhile, when this app is playing, other apps like QQ Music can't play. So this category is generally used by player-type apps._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord`: With players, there must be recorders. For example, WeChat voice message recording uses this category. Since you want quiet recording, you certainly don't want QQ Music playing, so other playback is interrupted. Think of the WeChat voice message scenario and you'll know when to use it._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategorySoloAmbient`: Also playback-only, but unlike `AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient`, with this one you can forget about listening to QQ Music — it's for Apps that don't want QQ Music interference, like Rhythm Master. Likewise, the audio is muted when the user locks the screen or mutes; once the screen is locked, you can't play Rhythm Master anymore._


Once we understand these seven categories, we can set the appropriate category according to our needs:

``` objc
- (BOOL)setCategory:(NSString *)category error:(NSError **)outError;
```

Just pass the corresponding category string. If it returns `NO`, you can check the cause via `NSError`'s `error.localizedDescription`.

You can use:

``` objc
@property(readonly) NSArray<NSString *> *availableCategories;
```

This property shows which categories the current device supports. Set the category based on it to guarantee the passed-in argument is valid and reduce the chance of errors.

For example, with the following code:

``` objc
	NSLog(@"Current Category:%@", [AVAudioSession sharedInstance].category);
    NSError *error = nil;
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback error:&error];
    if (nil != error) {
        NSLog(@"set Option error %@", error.localizedDescription);
    }
    NSLog(@"Current Category:%@", [AVAudioSession sharedInstance].category);

```

Now when playing music, if you press the mute switch, you'll find that the music keeps playing and isn't muted.


### Category Options



The seven categories above can be thought of as seven main scenarios, but these seven certainly can't satisfy all developer needs. `CoreAudio`'s approach is: __first pick one of the seven as the baseline, then fine-tune. `CoreAudio` provides a few options for each `Category` to do the fine-tuning.__


After setting the category, you can use:

``` objc
@property(readonly) AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions categoryOptions;
```

This property shows which options the current category has set. Note that the return value is `AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions`, __which is actually the `|` combination of multiple `options`__.  
By default it is `0`.

``` objc
typedef NS_OPTIONS(NSUInteger, AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions)
{
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers			= 0x1,
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers				= 0x2,
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth	__TVOS_PROHIBITED __WATCHOS_PROHIBITED		= 0x4,
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker __TVOS_PROHIBITED __WATCHOS_PROHIBITED		= 0x8,
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionInterruptSpokenAudioAndMixWithOthers NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(9_0) = 0x11,
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetoothA2DP API_AVAILABLE(ios(10.0), watchos(3.0), tvos(10.0)) = 0x20,
	AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowAirPlay API_AVAILABLE(ios(10.0), tvos(10.0)) __WATCHOS_PROHIBITED = 0x40,
} NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(6_0);
```


| Option | Applicable Categories | Effect | 
| :------ | :------ | :------: |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord, AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, and AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute | Whether it can mix with other background Apps |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers | AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient, AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord, AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback, and AVAudioSessionCategoryMultiRoute | Whether it lowers other Apps' audio |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth | AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord and AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord | Whether Bluetooth headsets are supported |
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord  | Whether it uses the speakerphone by default |

> These are the main options for now, each with corresponding use cases. Besides these, there are also some newly added after iOS 9

| Option | Applicable Categories | Effect | Minimum System |
| :------ | :------ | :------: | :------|
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionInterruptSpokenAudioAndMixWithOthers  | -- | -- | iOS 9|
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetoothA2DP  | -- | -- | iOS 10|
| AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowAirPlay  | -- | Supports Bluetooth A2DP headsets and AirPlay | iOS 10|


Below I'll explain the effect of each sub-scenario option:

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers`: If you really use `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback` for background audio but still want it to coexist with QQ Music, you can set this option under the `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback` category and the two can coexist._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDuckOthers`: In real-time call scenarios — for example, when making a video call, you'll notice that QQ Music's volume automatically drops. This is achieved by setting this option to duck other music Apps._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth`: If you want to support Bluetooth headset calls, you need to set this option._

* _`AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker`: If you want the speakerphone enabled by default in VoIP mode, you need to set this option._

Through the interface:

``` objc
- (BOOL)setCategory:(NSString *)category withOptions:(AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions)options error:(NSError **)outError;
```

you can set options on the current category.

Example code:

``` objc
- (void)xxxMethod{
    [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] setCategory:AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback withOptions:AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionMixWithOthers error:&error];
    if (nil != error) {
        NSLog(@"set Option error %@", error.localizedDescription);
    }
    options = [[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] categoryOptions];
    NSLog(@"Category[%@] has %lu options",  [AVAudioSession sharedInstance].category, options);
}
```

Now, if you open the QQ Music player and then start playing, you'll find that both QQ Music and our instance are playing, with automatic mixing.

### The Seven Modes

With the `seven categories` above:

``` objc
#pragma mark -- Values for the mode property --

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeDefault NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(5_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeVoiceChat NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(5_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeGameChat NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(5_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeVideoRecording NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(5_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeMeasurement NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(5_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeMoviePlayback NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(6_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeVideoChat NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(7_0);

AVF_EXPORT NSString *const AVAudioSessionModeSpokenAudio NS_AVAILABLE_IOS(9_0);
```


We've basically covered the common __main scenarios__. Within each main scenario, you can __fine-tune__ via `Option`. To this end, `CoreAudio` provides seven common fine-tuned sub-scenarios, called `the modes of each category`.

| Mode | Applicable Categories | Scenario | 
| :------ | :------ | :------: |
| AVAudioSessionModeDefault | All categories | Default mode |
| AVAudioSessionModeVoiceChat | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord  | VoIP |
| AVAudioSessionModeGameChat | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord | Game recording; set automatically by GKVoiceChat, no manual call needed |
| AVAudioSessionModeVideoRecording | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord | When recording video|
| AVAudioSessionModeMoviePlayback | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback | Video playback|
| AVAudioSessionModeMeasurement | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord AVAudioSessionCategoryRecord AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback | Minimal system |
| AVAudioSessionModeVideoChat | AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayAndRecord | Video calls |

Each mode has its applicable categories, so there aren't literally "7×7 = 49" combinations. If the current category doesn't support a mode, setting it will fail.  

After setting the Category, you can use the following code:

``` objc
@property(readonly) NSArray<NSString *> *availableModes;

```

This property shows which modes are supported, for validity checks.


Now let me talk about specific use cases:


* __`AVAudioSessionModeDefault`: Every category defaults to this mode, so to restore the default, set it back to this mode.__

* __`AVAudioSessionModeVoiceChat`: Mainly for VoIP scenarios. The system chooses the best input device — for example, when headphones are plugged in, it uses the headset microphone for capture. There's a side effect: it sets the category option to `AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth` to support Bluetooth headsets.__

* __`AVAudioSessionModeVideoChat`: Mainly for video calls, such as QQ Video and FaceTime. The system also chooses the best input device — for example, when headphones are plugged in, it uses the headset microphone for capture, and sets the category options to `AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionAllowBluetooth` and `AVAudioSessionCategoryOptionDefaultToSpeaker`.__

* __`AVAudioSessionModeGameChat`: Suited to game apps' capture and playback, e.g. the `GKVoiceChat` object; generally no manual setup is needed.__

> The other modes have little to do with audio apps; generally we only need to pay attention to VoIP or video calls.


By calling:

``` objc
- (BOOL)setMode:(NSString *)mode error:(NSError **)outError;
```

you can set the mode after setting the `Category`.

Of course, these modes are just summaries by `CoreAudio` and may not fully meet your needs. Even for specific modes, you can still fine-tune in `iOS10`.  

Through the interface:  

``` objc

- (BOOL)setCategory:(NSString *)category mode:(NSString *)mode options:(AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions)options error:(NSError **)outError;

```

But on `iOS9` and below, you can only adjust on the `Category`. In essence it's the same, and you can think of it as API syntactic sugar and interface encapsulation.

### Responding to System Interruptions

Everything above — `Category`, `Option`, and `Mode` — describes behavior when your app is the playback owner. But suppose something is currently playing and a call suddenly comes in, the alarm goes off, or the user launches another app that affects playback through the methods above — how should our app behave? The most common approach is to pause first, then resume when playback is restored. So how does our app sense this interruption and know when to resume?

`AVAudioSession` provides various `Notifications` for such situations. Incoming calls, alarms, and so on are all categorized as general interruptions.

They are reported via `AVAudioSessionInterruptionNotification`. The `userInfo` returned in the callback mainly contains two keys:

* _`AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeKey`: A value of `AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeBegan` means the interruption has begun, and we should pause playback and capture. A value of `AVAudioSessionInterruptionTypeEnded` means the interruption has ended, and we can resume playback and capture._

* _`AVAudioSessionInterruptionOptionKey`: Currently there's only one value, `AVAudioSessionInterruptionOptionShouldResume`, indicating that playback and capture should also be resumed now._

__When another `App` takes over the `AudioSession`, `AVAudioSessionSilenceSecondaryAudioHintNotification` is used to notify. The__`userInfo` key returned in the callback is:

``` objc
AVAudioSessionSilenceSecondaryAudioHintTypeKey
```

Possible values:

* `AVAudioSessionSilenceSecondaryAudioHintTypeBegin`: Indicates that another `App` has started occupying the `Session`.

* `AVAudioSessionSilenceSecondaryAudioHintTypeEnd`: Indicates that another `App` has started releasing the `Session`.


### Peripheral Changes

Besides other `Apps` and system services, the user's own actions can also affect our `App`. By default, the `AudioSession` picks an optimal output route when the `App` launches — for example, headphones when they're plugged in. But during this, the user might unplug the headphones. How does our app sense this?


Likewise, `AVAudioSession` also uses `Notifications` for such situations.

Suppose there's an app like this:
![](/assets/images/20180112AVAudioSessionCategory/RouteChange.avif)

At first, when recording, we stop recording when the user plugs in or unplugs the headphones. A `Notification` tells us a new device has appeared or a device was removed, and we control stopping the recording accordingly. Or during playback, when headphones are unplugged, the `Notification` fires and we pause the music, resuming when the headphones are plugged back in.

Register for `AVAudioSessionRouteChangeNotification` in `NSNotificationCenter`. Its `userInfo` contains these keys:

* `AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonKey`: Indicates the reason for the change
* `AVAudioSessionSilenceSecondaryAudioHintTypeKey`: Has the same meaning as the interruption above.


| Enum Value | Meaning |
| :------ | :------: | 
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonUnknown  | Unknown reason |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonNewDeviceAvailable  | A new device is available |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonOldDeviceUnavailable  | The old device is unavailable |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonCategoryChange  | The category changed |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonOverride  | The app reset its output settings |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonWakeFromSleep  | Woke from sleep |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonNoSuitableRouteForCategory  | No suitable device for the current Category |
| AVAudioSessionRouteChangeReasonRouteConfigurationChange  | The route configuration changed |


# Summary

`AVAudioSession` builds the context for an audio usage lifecycle. Whether the current state supports recording, what impact it has on other Apps, whether it responds to the system mute switch, how to detect incoming calls — all of these can be implemented through it. What's especially important is that `AVAudioSession` works not only with `AVAudioPlyaer`/`AVAudioRecorder` in `AVFoundation`, but other recording/playback tools such as `AudioUnit` and `AudioQueueService` also need it to provide the context for recording, muting, and so on.
