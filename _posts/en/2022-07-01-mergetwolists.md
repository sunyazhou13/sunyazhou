# As the Title Says

Merge two ascending-sorted linked lists into a new `ascending` linked list and return it. The new list is made by splicing together all the nodes of the two given lists.

#### Example 1

![](/assets/images/20220701MergeTwoLists/mergelinklist.avif)

``` sh
输入：l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
输出：[1,1,2,3,4,4]
```
#### Example 2

``` sh
输入：l1 = [], l2 = []
输出：[]
```
#### Example 3

``` sh
输入：l1 = [], l2 = [0]
输出：[0]
```

## Answer

``` c++
struct ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode *next;
    ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
    ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
};
 
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        if (list1 == nullptr) {
            return list2;
        } else if (list2 == nullptr) {
            return list1;
        } else if (list1->val < list2->val) {
            list1->next = mergeTwoLists(list1->next, list2);
            return list1;
        } else {
            list2->next = mergeTwoLists(list2->next, list1);
            return list2;
        }
    }
};
```
