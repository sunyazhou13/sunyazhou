## The problem encountered in development

![](/assets/images/20240819dispatchafterNSIntegermax/popup.avif)

Recently in development, a QA teammate filed a bug: the bubble on the home page's bottom tab flashed and disappeared instantly. After tracing through the code carefully, I found that the backend had issued `-1` in the configuration, and a client-side colleague replaced this `-1` with NSIntegerMax.

The following code is the implementation that controls a bubble from showing to disappearing.

``` objc
NSInteger delaySeconds = NSIntegerMax;
NSLog(@"%@,展示前,%zd",[NSDate date],delaySeconds);
dispatch_after(dispatch_time(DISPATCH_TIME_NOW, (int64_t)(delaySeconds * NSEC_PER_SEC)), dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
    NSLog(@"%@,展示后,%zd",[NSDate date],delaySeconds);
});
```

Suppose the code to hide the bubble is called 10 seconds after it shows, but this code executes immediately.

``` sh
2024-08-19 02:03:16 +0000,展示前,9223372036854775807
2024-08-19 02:03:16 +0000,展示后,9223372036854775807
```

### Why does it execute immediately?

![](/assets/images/20240819dispatchafterNSIntegermax/NSIntegerMax1.avif)

 `NSIntegerMax * NSEC_PER_SEC` = -1 billion

A negative number naturally triggers `dispatch_after()` to execute immediately.


When you encounter a case where `NSIntegerMax * NSEC_PER_SEC` results in a negative number, it usually means an integer overflow has occurred. `NSIntegerMax` represents the maximum value of the `NSInteger` type. When multiplied by `NSEC_PER_SEC` (the number of nanoseconds per second, equal to `1,000,000,000`), the result can exceed the range representable by `NSInteger`.

On 32-bit systems, `NSInteger` is a 32-bit integer whose maximum value is `2,147,483,647`. `NSEC_PER_SEC` is a very large number, so when multiplied together, the result exceeds the maximum value of a 32-bit integer, causing overflow.

On 64-bit systems, `NSInteger` is a 64-bit integer whose maximum value is `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`. Although a 64-bit integer has a much larger range, when multiplied by `NSEC_PER_SEC`, the result can still exceed the range of `NSInteger`, because `NSInteger` is actually a signed integer with a maximum value of `9,223,372,036,854,775,807`, and `NSEC_PER_SEC` times `NSIntegerMax` yields a number larger than this value.

Integer overflow usually occurs in two cases:

1. **Unsigned integer overflow**: When an unsigned integer reaches its maximum value and keeps increasing, it wraps around to 0 and starts counting again from 0.
2. **Signed integer overflow**: When a signed integer reaches its maximum value and keeps increasing, it becomes a negative number.

In this case, since `NSInteger` is signed, when the result of multiplying it by `NSEC_PER_SEC` exceeds its representable range, the result becomes negative.

To avoid this, you should use a larger data type, such as `uint64_t` or `int64_t`, which can safely store much larger values. For example:

```objective-c
uint64_t delayInNanoseconds = (uint64_t)NSIntegerMax * NSEC_PER_SEC;
```

Using `uint64_t` ensures the multiplication doesn't produce a negative number, because `uint64_t` is an unsigned 64-bit integer.

### Solution

* Define macros for the maximum length of two time units to replace the maximum value

``` objc
#define SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR 31536000LL // 非闰年
#define SECONDS_IN_A_LEAP_YEAR 31622400LL // 闰年
#define SECONDS_IN_A_MONTH 2629746LL  //一个月最大秒数
#define SECONDS_IN_A_DAY 86400  //一天最大秒数
```


In Objective-C, there's no standard macro that directly represents the maximum number of seconds in a day. However, you can use some basic time-unit macros to calculate the total number of seconds in a day.

A day has 24 hours, each hour has 60 minutes, and each minute has 60 seconds. So the total number of seconds in a day can be calculated with the following formula:

\[ \text{total seconds in a day} = 24 \times 60 \times 60 \]

The total seconds in a day = 24 * 60 * 60

That equals 86,400 seconds.

If you need to use this value in Objective-C code, you can define a macro or constant to represent it:

```objective-c
#define SECONDS_IN_A_DAY 86400
```

Or use a `const` constant:

```objective-c
const int64_t SecondsInADay = 86400LL;
```

Using the `int64_t` type ensures this constant is large enough to correctly represent the total seconds in a day even on 32-bit systems. The `LL` suffix ensures the number is interpreted as a long long integer (`long long`) constant.

In actual programming, you can use this value as needed for time calculations.

The number of days in a month and a year isn't fixed, because it depends on specific calendar rules. However, we can give some approximate values and calculation methods.

### Seconds in a month

For a month, we usually use an average value for approximation. A month has about 30.44 days on average (taking into account the varying days in different months and the effect of leap years). Therefore, the total seconds in a month can be approximated as:

\[ \text{total seconds in a month} \approx 30.44 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 \]

The result is approximately:

\[ 2,629,746 \text{ seconds} \]

In Objective-C, you can define the seconds in a month like this:

```objective-c
#define SECONDS_IN_A_MONTH 2629746LL
```

### Seconds in a year

For a year, we usually assume it has 365 days, except in leap years, when it has 366 days. Therefore, the total seconds in a year can be calculated as:

- Non-leap year:
  \[ \text{total seconds in a year} = 365 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 \]
- Leap year:
  \[ \text{total seconds in a year} = 366 \times 24 \times 60 \times 60 \]

Non-leap year:   
Total seconds in a year = 365 × 24 × 60 × 60  
Leap year:   
Total seconds in a year = 366 × 24 × 60 × 60

The results are approximately:

- Non-leap year: 31,536,000 seconds
- Leap year: 31,622,400 seconds

In Objective-C, you can define the seconds in a year like this:

```objective-c
#define SECONDS_IN_A_YEAR 31536000LL // 非闰年
#define SECONDS_IN_A_LEAP_YEAR 31622400LL // 闰年
```

Please note that these values are based on approximate calculations; actual month and year lengths may vary. When dealing with specific date and time calculations, you usually need to consider more complex calendar rules. In Objective-C, you can use the `NSCalendar` class and the `NSDate` class to handle dates and times more accurately.

# Summary

The core issue here is: don't multiply `NSIntegerMax` by `a value` and get a result that exceeds the maximum range `NSInteger` can represent. Be sure to watch out for this in development.
