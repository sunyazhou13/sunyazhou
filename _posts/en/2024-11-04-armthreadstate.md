# Background

A long time ago, I remember many interviewers liked to ask: what registers are in the ARM Thread State of an iOS dSYM, and what do they each mean?

Based on a piece of data, let's briefly record the answer to this question.

This is the thread state of the main-thread crash after a thread crashed.

## Meanings of the ARM Thread State Registers

In an iOS dSYM, the ARM Thread State registers provide the context of the program at the time of the crash. Here are the meanings of the main registers:

- **x0-x30**: These are general-purpose registers, used to store temporary data. In function calls, x0-x7 are usually used to pass arguments, while x19-x28 are used to hold local variables and function return addresses.
- **fp (Frame Pointer)**: The frame pointer register, typically pointing to the current function's stack frame, for managing the stack during function calls and returns and for accessing local variables.
- **lr (Link Register)**: The link register, storing the address to return to after a function call — i.e., the address of the next instruction to execute.
- **sp (Stack Pointer)**: The stack pointer register, pointing to the top of the current thread's stack.
- **pc (Program Counter)**: The program counter, pointing to the address of the next instruction to execute.
- **cpsr (Current Program Status Register)**: The current program status register, containing the processor's status and control bits, such as condition flags and interrupt enable bits.

In the crash log shown above, the pc register's value is `0x00000001d8922e44`, which usually points to the instruction address that caused the crash. You can use the `atos` command together with the dSYM file to resolve this address to a code location, for example:

``` bash
atos -arch arm64 -o YourApp.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/YourApp -l 0xXXXXXXXX 0xXXXXXXXX
```

Here, -arch arm64 specifies the architecture, -o is followed by the path to the dSYM file, and -l is followed by the load address and the pc register's value. This helps you find the line of code executing at the time of the crash.

## How to Resolve the `pc` Value in the ARM Thread State Registers?

Resolving the `pc` (Program Counter) value in the ARM Thread State registers usually involves the following steps:

1.**Get the `pc` value at crash time**:

 This is the memory address of the instruction that caused the program to crash. In your crash log, the value of `pc` is `0x00000001d8922e44`.

2.**Get the application's dSYM file**:

 The dSYM file contains the application's debug information, including the symbol tables that map memory addresses to functions and line numbers in the source code. Make sure you have the dSYM file matching the application version at the time of the crash.

3.**Use debugging tools to resolve the address**:

 You can use Xcode's debugging tools, or command-line tools such as `atos` (Address to Symbol), to convert the `pc` value into the function name and line number in the source code.

Here's a command-line example using `atos`:

``` bash
atos -arch arm64 -o YourApp.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/YourApp -l 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   
```

Where:

* `-arch arm64` specifies the architecture type.
* `-o` is followed by the path to your application's dSYM file.
* ` -l` is followed by the load address and the pc register's value.

Please replace YourApp.app.dSYM/Contents/Resources/DWARF/YourApp with your actual dSYM file path, and replace 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and 0xXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your actual load address and pc value.

4. Analyze the result:
The atos command outputs the function name and line number where the crash occurred. For example:

``` bash
0x00000001d8922e44: -[YourViewController yourMethod] (YourViewController.m:123)
```   

This indicates the crash happened in the yourMethod method of the YourViewController class, at line 123 of YourViewController.m.

5. Debug and fix:
Based on the resolved function name and line number, you can locate the exact position in the source code, and further analyze and fix the problem that caused the crash.
