# Background

Creating posts for this blog has always been a bit awkward. The site runs on Jekyll with the Chirpy theme, and posts are created via the command provided by [jekyll-compose](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-compose):

``` sh
bundle exec jekyll post "My New Post"
```

Anyone who migrated from Hexo knows how good its workflow is: `hexo new` creates a post from the `scaffolds/post.md` template, so boilerplate content (like the disclaimer at the top of every post on this site) comes in automatically.

Jekyll has two pain points here:

1. **No body template**: jekyll-compose only generates front matter. The disclaimer paragraph has to be manually pasted every time.
2. **Multi-language unfriendly**: This site is bilingual (Chinese/English) via [jekyll-polyglot](https://github.com/untra/polyglot). Chinese posts live in `_posts/` and English posts in `_posts/en/`, but `jekyll post` only writes to `_posts/` — the English version needs a manual copy and rename.

This time I solved both problems together with a wrapper script that brings Hexo-style scaffolds and one-command multi-language post creation to Jekyll.

# Analysis

Before writing any code, I dug into the jekyll-compose 0.12.0 source and confirmed two things:

## The path is hardcoded

From `lib/jekyll/commands/post.rb`:

``` ruby
class PostFileInfo < Compose::FileInfo
  def path
    "_posts/#{file_name}"
  end
end
```

The destination is hardcoded to `_posts/` with no option or configuration to target a subdirectory. Having the command write directly into `_posts/en/` is impossible — the file can only be moved after creation.

## No body template support

From `lib/jekyll-compose/file_info.rb`:

``` ruby
def content(custom_front_matter = {})
  front_matter = YAML.dump({
    "layout" => params.layout,
    "title"  => params.title,
  }.merge(custom_front_matter))

  front_matter + "---\n"
end
```

The `content` method outputs YAML front matter and stops. There is no logic to read a template file and inject body content. The plugin simply does not offer this capability, so it has to be done at the script level.

The only configuration point is `default_front_matter`, which merges custom fields into the front matter — that becomes useful later.

## How multi-language detection works

The polyglot configuration on this site:

``` yaml
languages: ["zh", "en"]
default_lang: "zh"
lang_from_path: true
```

With `lang_from_path: true`, the language is inferred from the path: posts in the `_posts/` root are the default language (Chinese), and posts under `_posts/en/` are automatically detected as English — **no** `lang: en` needed in front matter.

One critical detail: the Chinese and English versions must share **exactly the same filename**, otherwise polyglot won't treat them as translations of the same post and won't generate hreflang tags or the language switch links.

# Implementation

The overall approach is straightforward: a `tools/newpost.sh` wrapper script that calls jekyll-compose, then handles the directory move and template injection.

## Directory layout

``` sh
tools/
├── newpost.sh              # post creation script
└── scaffolds/              # body templates (like hexo scaffolds)
    ├── post.md             # Chinese template
    └── post.en.md          # English template
```

## Body templates

`tools/scaffolds/post.md` is the standard opening of every post on this site, and `tools/scaffolds/post.en.md` is its English counterpart. To change the boilerplate, just edit the template — all future posts pick it up automatically, exactly like editing `scaffolds/post.md` in Hexo.

## Front matter template

jekyll-compose natively supports default front matter in `_config.yml`:

``` yaml
jekyll_compose:
  default_front_matter:
    posts:
      categories: [iOS]
      tags: []
      typora-root-url: ..
```

**Watch out**: the key must be `posts` (plural). Writing `post` fails silently — the source hardcodes `front_matter_defaults_for("posts")`, which you'd only discover by reading the code.

## The creation script

Core logic of `tools/newpost.sh`:

``` bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"
EN_DIR="$ROOT/_posts/en"

# If the first arg is zh/en/both followed by a title, use explicit mode;
# otherwise treat it as the title
if [[ "$1" == zh || "$1" == en || "$1" == both ]] && [[ $# -ge 2 ]]; then
  LANG_ARG="$1"
  TITLE="$2"
else
  TITLE="$1"
  # Default mode: bilingual if _posts/en/ exists, Chinese only otherwise
  if [[ -d "$EN_DIR" ]]; then
    LANG_ARG="both"
  else
    LANG_ARG="zh"
  fi
fi

create_post() {
  # Output looks like "New post created at \e[36m_posts/xxx.md\e[0m "
  # Strip the prefix and ANSI color codes, or path checks will fail
  bundle exec jekyll post "$TITLE" 2>&1 \
    | grep "New post created at" \
    | sed -e $'s/\x1b\\[[0-9;]*m//g' \
          -e 's/^New post created at //' \
          -e 's/[[:space:]]*$//'
}

# Append template content to the post body
apply_scaffold() {
  local file="$1" lang="$2" s
  if [[ "$lang" == "en" ]]; then
    s="$ROOT/tools/scaffolds/post.en.md"
  else
    s="$ROOT/tools/scaffolds/post.md"
  fi
  [[ -f "$s" ]] || return 0
  printf '\n' >> "$file"
  cat "$s" >> "$file"
}

FILE=$(create_post)

case "$LANG_ARG" in
  zh)
    apply_scaffold "$ROOT/$FILE" zh
    ;;
  en)
    [[ -d "$EN_DIR" ]] || mkdir -p "$EN_DIR"
    mv "$ROOT/$FILE" "$EN_DIR/"
    apply_scaffold "$EN_DIR/$(basename "$FILE")" en
    ;;
  both)
    [[ -d "$EN_DIR" ]] || mkdir -p "$EN_DIR"
    # Copy the clean English version first (before injecting
    # the Chinese template), then inject each template
    cp "$ROOT/$FILE" "$EN_DIR/$(basename "$FILE")"
    apply_scaffold "$ROOT/$FILE" zh
    apply_scaffold "$EN_DIR/$(basename "$FILE")" en
    ;;
esac
```

# Usage

``` sh
# Most common: just pass the title, bilingual by default
bash tools/newpost.sh "My New Post"

# Chinese only
bash tools/newpost.sh zh "My New Post"

# English only (goes to _posts/en/)
bash tools/newpost.sh en "My New Post"

# Force bilingual (creates _posts/en/ if missing)
bash tools/newpost.sh both "My New Post"
```

The default mode checks whether `_posts/en/` exists: if so, both Chinese and English versions are created; if not, only the Chinese one. One command produces:

``` markdown
---
layout: post
title: My New Post
date: 2026-08-22 06:06 +0000
categories:
- iOS
tags: []
typora-root-url: ".."

# Preface

This post reflects strong personal opinions. If you feel uncomfortable while reading, please close it immediately. ...
```

The English version gets the English Preface template automatically. Both files share the same filename, so polyglot recognizes them as translations right away.

# Pitfalls

Every pitfall below was located by reading source code:

1. **ANSI color codes pollute the output**: jekyll prints `New post created at` followed by an `\e[36m` escape sequence. A plain `sed` prefix removal leaves the escape code in front of the path, so the `-f` check always fails. The `\x1b\[[0-9;]*m` sequences must be stripped first.
2. **Plural config key**: under `jekyll_compose.default_front_matter`, the key is `posts`, not `post`. The wrong key produces no error and silently does nothing.
3. **Can't create the same post twice**: bilingual posts must be "create once, then copy" — running `jekyll post` twice with the same title fails on the second run because the file already exists.
4. **Titles must be English**: jekyll-compose's slugification drops all non-ASCII characters, so a Chinese title produces a filename with nothing but the date. My workflow: pass an English title, then edit the `title` field in front matter to Chinese afterwards.

# Summary

The whole change touches only a few files — no theme hacks, no plugin patches, purely at the script level:

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/newpost.sh` | Added: wrapper around jekyll-compose |
| `tools/scaffolds/post.md` | Added: Chinese body template |
| `tools/scaffolds/post.en.md` | Added: English body template |
| `_config.yml` | Added `jekyll_compose.default_front_matter.posts` config |

It's been almost nine years since I migrated from Hexo to Jekyll, and scaffolds were the one thing I kept missing. Now it's finally filled in: creating a post went from "run command + manual copy/rename + paste disclaimer" to a single command, with the bilingual filename consistency guaranteed as well.
